    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The "first edition" has been a favourite theme for the scorn of those who
      love it not. "The first edition&mdash;and the worst!" gibes a modern poet,
      and many are the true lovers of literature entirely insensitive to the
      accessory, historical or sentimental, associations of books. The present
      writer possesses a copy of one of Walton's Lives, that of Bishop
      Sanderson, with the author's donatory inscription to a friend upon the
      title-page. To keep this in his little library he has undergone willingly
      many privations, cheerfully faced hunger and cold rather than let it pass
      from his hand; yet, how often when, tremulously, he has unveiled this
      treasure to his visitors, how often has it been examined with undilating
      eyes, and cold, unenvious hearts! Yet so he must confess himself to have
      looked upon a friend's superb first edition of "Pickwick" though surely
      not without that measure of interest which all, save the quite unlettered
      or unintelligent, must feel in seeing the first visible shape of a book of
      such resounding significance in English literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such interest may, without fear of denial, be claimed for a facsimile of
      the first edition of "The Compleat Angler" after "Robinson Crusoe" perhaps
      the most popular of English classics. Thomas Westwood, whose gentle
      poetry, it is to be feared, has won but few listeners, has drawn this
      fancy picture of the commotion in St. Dunstan's Churchyard on a May
      morning of the year 1653, when Richard Marriott first published the famous
      discourse, little dreaming that he had been chosen for the godfather of so
      distinguished an immortality. The lines form an epilogue to twelve
      beautiful sonnets à propos <i>of the bi-centenary of Walton's death: </i>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 "What, not a word for thee, O little tome,
  Brown-jerkined, friendly-faced&mdash;of all my books
  The one that wears the quaintest, kindliest looks&mdash;
  Seems most completely, cosily at home
  Amongst its fellows. Ah! if thou couldst tell
  Thy story&mdash;how, in sixteen fifty-three,
  Good Master Marriott, standing at its door,
  Saw Anglers hurrying&mdash;fifty&mdash;nay, three score,
  To buy thee ere noon pealed from Dunstan's bell:&mdash;
  And how he stared and ... shook his sides with glee.
  One story, this, which fact or fiction weaves.
  Meanwhile, adorn my shelf, beloved of all&mdash;
  Old book! with lavender between thy leaves,
  And twenty ballads round thee on the wall."
</pre>
    <p>
      Whether there was quite such a rush as this on its publishing day we have
      no certain knowledge, though Westwood, in his "Chronicle of the Compleat
      Angler" speaks of "the almost immediate sale of the entire edition."
      According to Sir Harris Nicolas, it was thus advertised in<i> The Perfect
      Diurnall</i>: from Monday, May 9th, to Monday, May 16th, 1653:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"The Compleat Angler, or the Contemplative Man's Recreation</i>, being
      a discourse of Fish and Fishing, not unworthy the perusal of most Anglers,
      of 18 pence price. Written by Iz. Wa. Also the Gipsee, never till now
      published: Both printed for Richard Marriot, to be sold at his shop in
      Saint Dunstan's Churchyard, Fleet street."
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was thus calmly, unexcitedly noticed in the Mercurius Politicus:
      from Thursday, May 12, to Thursday, May 19, 1653: <i>"There is newly
      extant, a Book of 18d. price, called the Compleat Angler, or the
      Contemplative Man's Recreation, being a discourse of Fish and Fishing, not
      unworthy the perusal of most Anglers. Printed for Richard Marriot, to be
      sold at his shop in St. Dunstan's Churchyard, Fleet street</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus for it, as for most great births, the bare announcement sufficed. One
      of the most beautiful of the world's books had been born into the world,
      and was still to be bought in its birthday form&mdash;for eighteen-pence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1816, Mr. Marston calculates, the market value was about £4 4s. In 1847
      Dr. Bethune estimated it at £12 12s. In 1883 Westwood reckoned it "from
      £70 to £80 or even more" and since then copies have fetched £235 and £310,
      though in 1894 we have a sudden drop at Sotheby's to £150&mdash;which,
      however, was more likely due to the state of the copy than to any
      diminution in the zeal of Waltonian collectors, a zeal, indeed, which
      burns more ardently from year to year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sufficiently out of reach of the poor collector as it is at present, it is
      probable that it will mount still higher, and consent only to belong to
      richer and richer men. And thus, in course of time, this facsimile will,
      in clerical language, find an increasing sphere of usefulness; for it is
      to those who have more instant demands to satisfy with their hundred-pound
      notes that this facsimile is designed to bring consolation. If it is not
      the rose itself, it is a photographic refection of it, and it will
      undoubtedly give its possessor a sufficiently faithful idea of its
      original.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, apart from the satisfaction of such curiosity, the facsimile has a
      literary value, in that it differs very materially from succeeding
      editions. The text by which "The Compleat Angler" is generally known is
      that of the fifth edition, published in 1676, the last which Walton
      corrected and finally revised, seven years before his death. But in the
      second edition (1655) the book was already very near to its final shape,
      for Walton had enlarged it by about a third, and the dialogue was now
      sustained by three persons, Piscator, Venator and Auceps, instead of two&mdash;the
      original "Viator" also having changed his name to "Venator." Those
      interested in tracing the changes will find them all laboriously noted in
      Sir Harris Nicolas's great edition. Of the further additions made in the
      fifth edition, Sir Harris Nicolas makes this just criticism: "It is
      questionable," he says, "whether the additions which he then made to it
      have increased its interest. The garrulity and sentiments of an
      octogenarian are very apparent in some of the alterations; and the subdued
      colouring of religious feeling which prevails throughout the former
      editions, and forms one of the charms of the piece, is, in this
      impression, so much heightened as to become almost obtrusive."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a third raison d'être for this facsimile, which to name with
      approbation will no doubt seem impiety to many, but which, as a personal
      predilection, I venture to risk&mdash;there is no Cotton! The relation
      between Walton and Cotton is a charming incongruity to contemplate, and
      one stands by their little fishing-house in Dovedale as before an altar of
      friendship. Happy and pleasant in their lives, it is good to see them
      still undivided in their deaths&mdash;but, to my mind, their association
      between the boards of the same book mars a charming classic. No doubt
      Cotton has admirably caught the spirit of his master, but the very
      cleverness with which he has done it increases the sense of parody with
      which his portion of the book always offends me. Nor can I be the only
      reader of the book for whom it ends with that gentle benediction&mdash;"And
      upon all that are lovers of virtue, and dare trust in his providence, and
      be quiet, and go a Angling"&mdash;and that sweet exhortation from I Thess.
      iv. 11&mdash;"Study to be quiet."
    </p>
    <p>
      After the exquisite quietism of this farewell, it is distracting to come
      precipitately upon the fine gentleman with the great wig and the
      Frenchified airs. This is nothing against "hearty, cheerful Mr. Cotton's
      strain" of which, in Walton's own setting and in his own poetical issues,
      I am a sufficient admirer. Cotton was a clever literary man, and a fine
      engaging figure of a gentleman, but, save by the accident of friendship,
      he has little more claim to be printed along with Walton than the gallant
      Col. Robert Venables, who, in the fifth edition, contributed still a third
      part, entitled "The Experienc'd Angler: or, Angling Improv'd. Being a
      General Discourse of Angling," etc., to a book that was immortally
      complete in its first.
    </p>
    <p>
      While "The Compleat Angler" was regarded mainly as a text-book for
      practical anglers, one can understand its publisher wishing to make it as
      complete as possible by the addition of such technical appendices; but
      now, when it has so long been elevated above such literary drudgery, there
      is no further need for their perpetuation. For I imagine that the men
      to-day who really catch fish, as distinguished from the men who write
      sentimentally about angling, would as soon think of consulting Izaak
      Walton as they would Dame Juliana Berners. But anyone can catch fish&mdash;can
      he, do you say?&mdash;the thing is to have so written about catching them
      that your book is a pastoral, the freshness of which a hundred editions
      have left unexhausted,&mdash;a book in which the grass is for ever green,
      and the shining brooks do indeed go on forever.

    <p>
      To the Right Worshipful JOHN OFFLEY Of MADELY Manor in the County of <i>Stafford</i>,
      Esq, My most honoured Friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made so ill use of your former favors, as by them to be encouraged
      to intreat that they may be enlarged to the patronage and protection of
      this Book; and I have put on a modest confidence, that I shall not be
      denyed, because 'tis a discourse of Fish and Fishing, which you both know
      so well, and love and practice so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are assur'd (though there be ignorant men of an other belief) that
      Angling is an Art; and you know that Art better then any that I know: and
      that this is truth, is demostrated by the fruits of that pleasant labor
      which you enjoy when you purpose to give rest to your mind, and devest
      your self of your more serious business, and (which is often) dedicate a
      day or two to this Recreation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At which time, if common Anglers should attend you, and be eye-witnesses
      of the success, not of your fortune, but your skill, it would doubtless
      beget in them an emulation to be like you, and that emulation might beget
      an industrious diligence to be so: but I know it is not atainable by
      common capacities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir, this pleasant curiositie of Fish and Fishing (of which you are so
      great a Master) has been thought worthy the</i> pens <i>and</i> practices
      <i>of divers in other Nations, which have been reputed men of great</i>
      Learning <i>and</i> Wisdome; <i>and amongst those of this Nation, I
      remember Sir</i> Henry Wotton <i>(a dear lover of this Art) has told me,
      that his intentions were to write a discourse of the Art, and in the
      praise of Angling, and doubtless he had done so, if death had not
      prevented him; the remembrance of which hath often made me sorry; for, if
      he had lived to do it, then the unlearned Angler (of which I am one) had
      seen some Treatise of this Art worthy his perusal, which (though some have
      undertaken it) I could never yet see in English. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But mine may be thought: as weak and as unworthy of common view: and I do
      here freely confess that I should rather excuse myself, then censure
      others my own Discourse being liable to so many exceptions; against which,
      you (Sir) might make this one, That it can contribute nothing to your
      knowledge; and lest a longer Epistle may diminish your pleasure, I shall
      not adventure to make this Epistle longer then to add this following
      truth, That I am really, Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      Your most affectionate Friend, and most humble Servant,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                             Iz. Wa.
</pre>
    <p>
      To the <i>Reader of this Discourse</i>: But especially, To the honest
      ANGLER.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think fit to tell thee these following truths; that I did not undertake
      to write, or to publish this discourse of <i>fish</i> and <i>fishing</i>,
      to please my self, and that I wish it may not displease others; for, I
      have confest there are many defects in it. And yet, I cannot doubt, but
      that by it, some readers may receive so much <i>profit</i> or <i>pleasure</i>,
      as if they be not very busie men, may make it not unworthy the time of
      their perusall; and this is all the confidence that I can put on
      concerning the merit of this Book.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I wish the Reader also to take notice, that in writing of it, I have
      made a recreation, of a recreation; and that it might prove so to thee in
      the reading, and not to read <i>dull</i>, and <i>tediously</i>, I have in
      severall places mixt some innocent Mirth; of which, if thou be a severe,
      sowr complexioned man, then I here disallow thee to be a competent Judg.
      For Divines say, <i>there are offences given; and offences taken, but not
      given</i>. And I am the willinger to justifie this <i>innocent Mirth</i>,
      because the whole discourse is a kind of picture of my owne disposition,
      at least of my disposition in such daies and times as I allow my self,
      when honest <i>Nat</i>. and <i>R. R.</i> and I go a fishing together; and
      let me adde this, that he that likes not the discourse, should like the
      pictures the <i>Trout</i> and other fish, which I may commend, because
      they concern not my self. And I am also to tel the Reader, that in that
      which is the more usefull part of this discourse; that is to say, the
      observations of the <i>nature</i> and <i>breeding</i>, and <i>seasons</i>,
      and <i>catching of fish</i>, I am not so simple as not to think but that
      he may find exceptions in some of these; and therefore I must intreat him
      to know, or rather note, that severall Countreys, and several Rivers alter
      the <i>time</i> and <i>manner</i> of fishes Breeding; and therefore if he
      bring not candor to the reading of this Discourse, he shall both injure
      me, and possibly himself too by too many Criticisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for the Art of catching fish; that is to say, how to make a man that
      was none, an Angler by a book: he that undertakes it, shall undertake a
      harder task then <i>Hales</i> offered to thy view and censure; I with thee
      as much in the perusal of it, and so might that in his printed Book
      [called the private School of defence] undertook by it to teach the Art of
      Fencing, and was laught at for his labour. Not but that something usefull
      might be observed out of that Book; but that Art was not to be taught by
      words; nor is the Art of Angling. And yet, I think, that most that love
      that Game, may here learn something that may be worth their money, if they
      be not needy: and if they be, then my advice is, that they forbear; for, I
      write not to get money, but for pleasure; and this discourse boasts of no
      more: for I hate to promise much, and fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      But pleasure I have found both in the <i>search</i> and <i>conference</i>
      about what is here offered to thy view and censure; I wish thee as much in
      the perusal of it, and so might here take my leave; but I will stay thee a
      little longer by telling thee, that whereas it is said by many, that in <i>Fly-fishing</i>
      for a <i>Trout</i>, the Angler must observe his twelve <i>Flyes</i> for
      every Month; I say, if he observe that, he shall be as certain to catch
      fish, as they that make Hay by the fair dayes in Almanacks, and be no
      surer: for doubtless, three or four <i>Flyes</i> rightly made, do serve
      for a <i>Trout</i> all <i>Summer</i>, and for <i>Winter-flies</i>, all <i>Anglers</i>
      know, they are as useful as an <i>Almanack</i> out of date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these (because no man is born an <i>Artist</i> nor an <i>Angler</i>) I
      thought fit to give thee this notice. I might say more, but it is not fit
      for this place; but if this Discourse which follows shall come to a second
      impression, which is possible, for slight books have been in this Age
      observed to have that fortune; I shall then for thy sake be glad to
      correct what is faulty, or by a conference with any to explain or enlarge
      what is defective: but for this time I have neither a willingness nor
      leasure to say more, then wish thee a rainy evening to read this book in,
      and that the east wind may never blow when thou goest a fishing. Farewel.

      Because in this Discourse of <i>Fish</i> and <i>Fishing</i> I have not
      observed a method, which (though the Discourse be not long) may be some
      inconvenience to the Reader, I have therefore for his easier finding out
      some particular things which are spoken of, made this following Table.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The first Chapter is spent in a</i> vindication <i>or</i> commendation
      <i>of the Art of Angling</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>In the second are some observations of the nature of the</i> Otter, <i>and

      | PISCATOR |
      | VIATOR   |
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Piscator</i>. You are wel overtaken Sir; a good morning to you; I have
      stretch'd my legs up <i>Totnam Hil</i> to overtake you, hoping your
      businesse may occasion you towards <i>Ware</i>, this fine pleasant fresh
      <i>May day</i> in the Morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viator</i>. Sir. I shall almost answer your hopes: for my purpose is to
      be at <i>Hodsden</i> (three miles short of that Town) I wil not say,
      before I drink; but before I break my fast: for I have appointed a friend
      or two to meet me there at the thatcht house, about nine of the clock this
      morning; and that made me so early up, and indeed, to walk so fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Sir, I know the <i>thatcht house</i> very well: I often make
      it my resting place, and taste a cup of Ale there, for which liquor that
      place is very remarkable; and to that house I shall by your favour
      accompany you, and either abate of my pace, or mend it, to enjoy such a
      companion as you seem to be, knowing that (as the Italians say) <i>Good
      company makes the way seem shorter</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. It may do so Sir, with the help of good discourse, which (me
      thinks) I may promise from you, that both look and speak so cheerfully.
      And to invite you to it, I do here promise you, that for my part, I will
      be as free and open-hearted, as discretion will warrant me to be with a
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Sir, I am right glad of your answer; and in confidence that
      you speak the truth, I shall (Sir) put on a boldness to ask, whether
      pleasure or businesse has occasioned your Journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Indeed, Sir, a little business, and more pleasure: for my
      purpose is to bestow a day or two in hunting the <i>Otter</i> (which my
      friend that I go to meet, tells me is more pleasant then any hunting
      whatsoever:) and having dispatched a little businesse this day, my purpose
      is tomorrow to follow a pack of dogs of honest Mr. &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;,
      who hath appointed me and my friend to meet him upon <i>Amwel hill</i> to
      morrow morning by day break.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Sir, my fortune hath answered my desires; and my purpose is
      to bestow a day or two in helping to destroy some of those villainous
      vermin: for I hate them perfectly, because they love fish so well, or
      rather, because they destroy so much: indeed, so much, that in my
      judgment, all men that keep Otter dogs ought to have a Pension from the
      Commonwealth to incourage them to destroy the very breed of those base <i>Otters</i>,
      they do so much mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. But what say you to the <i>Foxes</i> of this Nation? would
      not you as willingly have them destroyed? for doubtlesse they do as much
      mischief as the <i>Otters</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Oh Sir, if they do, it is not so much to me and my
      Fraternitie, as that base Vermin the <i>Otters</i> do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Why Sir, I pray, of what Fraternity are you, that you are so
      angry with the poor <i>Otter</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. I am a Brother of the <i>Angle</i>, and therefore an enemy to
      the <i>Otter</i>, he does me and my friends so much mischief; for you are
      to know, that we <i>Anglers</i> all love one another: and therefore do I
      hate the <i>Otter</i> perfectly, even for their sakes that are of my
      Brotherhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Sir, to be plain with you, I am sorry you are an <i>Angler</i>:
      for I have heard many grave, serious men pitie, and many pleasant men
      scoff at <i>Anglers</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Sir, There are many men that are by others taken to be
      serious grave men, which we contemn and pitie; men of sowre complexions;
      mony-getting-men, that spend all their time first in getting, and next in
      anxious care to keep it: men that are condemn'd to be rich, and alwayes
      discontented, or busie. For these poor-rich-men, wee Anglers pitie them;
      and stand in no need to borrow their thoughts to think our selves happie:
      For (trust me, Sir) we enjoy a contentednesse above the reach of such
      dispositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as for any scoffer, <i>qui mockat mockabitur</i>. Let mee tell you,
      (that you may tell him) what the wittie French-man [the Lord Mountagne in
      his Apol. for Ra-Se-bond.] sayes in such a Case. <i>When my</i> Cat <i>and
      I entertaine each other with mutuall apish tricks (as playing with a
      garter,) who knows but that I make her more sport then she makes me? Shall
      I conclude her simple, that has her time to begin or refuse sportivenesse
      as freely as I my self have? Nay, who knows but that our agreeing no
      better, is the defect of my not understanding her language? (for
      doubtlesse Cats talk and reason with one another) and that shee laughs at,
      and censures my folly, for making her sport, and pities mee for
      understanding her no better?</i> To this purpose speaks <i>Mountagne</i>
      concerning <i>Cats</i>: And I hope I may take as great a libertie to blame
      any Scoffer, that has never heard what an Angler can say in the
      justification of his Art and Pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, if this satisfie not, I pray bid the Scoffer put this Epigram into
      his pocket, and read it every morning for his breakfast (for I wish him no
      better;) Hee shall finde it fix'd before the Dialogues of <i>Lucian</i>
      (who may be justly accounted the father of the Family of all <i>Scoffers</i>:)
      And though I owe none of that Fraternitie so much as good will, yet I have
      taken a little pleasant pains to make such a conversion of it as may make
      it the fitter for all of that Fraternity.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Lucian <i>well skill'd in</i> scoffing, <i>this has writ,
   Friend, that's your folly which you think your wit;
   This you vent oft, void both of wit and fear,
   Meaning an other, when your self you jeer</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      But no more of the <i>Scoffer</i>; for since <i>Solomon</i> sayes, he is
      an abomination to men, he shall be so to me; and I think, to all that love
      <i>Vertue</i> and <i>Angling</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Sir, you have almost amazed me [Pro 24. 9]: for though I am
      no Scoffer, yet I have (I pray let me speak it without offence) alwayes
      look'd upon <i>Anglers</i> as more patient, and more simple men, then (I
      fear) I shall finde you to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Piscat</i>. Sir, I hope you will not judge my earnestnesse to be
      impatience: and for my <i>simplicitie</i>, if by that you mean a <i>harmlessnesse</i>,
      or that <i>simplicity</i> that was usually found in the Primitive
      Christians, who were (as most <i>Anglers</i> are) quiet men, and followed
      peace; men that were too wise to sell their consciences to buy riches for
      vexation, and a fear to die. Men that lived in those times when there were
      fewer Lawyers; for then a Lordship might have been safely conveyed in a
      piece of Parchment no bigger then your hand, though several skins are not
      sufficient to do it in this wiser Age. I say, Sir, if you take us Anglers
      to be such simple men as I have spoken of, then both my self, and those of
      my profession will be glad to be so understood. But if by simplicitie you
      meant to expresse any general defect in the understanding of those that
      professe and practice <i>Angling</i>, I hope to make it appear to you,
      that there is so much contrary reason (if you have but the patience to
      hear it) as may remove all the anticipations that Time or Discourse may
      have possess'd you with, against that Ancient and laudable Art.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Why (Sir) is Angling of Antiquitie, and an Art, and an art
      not easily learn'd?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Yes (Sir:) and I doubt not but that if you and I were to
      converse together but til night, I should leave you possess'd with the
      same happie thoughts that now possesse me; not onely for the Antiquitie of
      it, but that it deserves commendations; and that 'tis an Art; and worthy
      the knowledge and practice of a wise, and a serious man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Sir, I pray speak of them what you shall think fit; for wee
      have yet five miles to walk before wee shall come to the <i>Thatcht house</i>.
      And, Sir, though my infirmities are many, yet I dare promise you, that
      both my patience and attention will indure to hear what you will say till
      wee come thither: and if you please to begin in order with the antiquity,
      when that is done, you shall not want my attention to the commendations
      and accommodations of it: and lastly, if you shall convince me that 'tis
      an Art, and an Art worth learning, I shall beg I may become your Scholer,
      both to wait upon you, and to be instructed in the Art it self.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Oh Sir, 'tis not to be questioned, but that it is an art, and
      an art worth your Learning: the question wil rather be, whether you be
      capable of learning it? For he that learns it, must not onely bring an
      enquiring, searching, and discerning wit; but he must bring also that <i>patience</i>
      you talk of, and a love and propensity to the art itself: but having once
      got and practised it, then doubt not but the Art will (both for the
      pleasure and profit of it) prove like to <i>Vertue, a reward to it self</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Sir, I am now become so ful of expectation, that I long much
      to have you proceed in your discourse: And first, I pray Sir, let me hear
      concerning the antiquity of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Sir, I wil preface no longer, but proceed in order as you
      desire me: And first for the Antiquity of <i>Angling</i>, I shall not say
      much; but onely this; Some say, it is as ancient as <i>Deucalions</i>
      Floud: and others (which I like better) say, that <i>Belus</i> (who was
      the inventer of godly and vertuous Recreations) was the Inventer of it:
      and some others say, (for former times have had their Disquisitions about
      it) that <i>Seth</i>, one of the sons of <i>Adam</i>, taught it to his
      sons, and that by them it was derived to Posterity. Others say, that he
      left it engraven on those Pillars which hee erected to preserve the
      knowledg of the <i>Mathematicks, Musick</i>, and the rest of those
      precious Arts, which by Gods appointment or allowance, and his noble
      industry were thereby preserved from perishing in <i>Noah's</i> Floud.
    </p>
    <p>
      These (my worthy Friend) have been the opinions of some men, that possibly
      may have endeavoured to make it more ancient then may well be warranted.
      But for my part, I shall content my self in telling you, That <i>Angling</i>
      is much more ancient then the incarnation of our Saviour: For both in the
      Prophet <i>Amos</i> [Chap. 42], and before him in <i>Job</i> [Chap. 41],
      (which last Book is judged to be written by <i>Moses</i>) mention is made
      <i>fish-hooks</i>, which must imply <i>Anglers</i> in those times.
    </p>
    <p>
      But (my worthy friend) as I would rather prove my self to be a Gentleman,
      by being <i>learned</i> and <i>humble, valiant</i> and <i>inoffensive,
      vertuous</i> and <i>communicable</i>, then by a fond ostentation of <i>riches</i>;
      or (wanting these Vertues my self) boast that these were in my Ancestors;
      [And yet I confesse, that where a noble and ancient Descent and such
      Merits meet in any man, it is a double dignification of that person:] and
      so, if this Antiquitie of Angling (which, for my part, I have not forc'd)
      shall like an ancient Familie, by either an honour, or an ornament to this
      vertuous Art which I both love and practise, I shall be the gladder that I
      made an accidental mention of it; and shall proceed to the justification,
      or rather commendation of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. My worthy Friend, I am much pleased with your discourse, for
      that you seem to be so ingenuous, and so modest, as not to stretch
      arguments into Hyperbolicall expressions, but such as indeed they will
      reasonably bear; and I pray, proceed to the justification, or
      commendations of Angling, which I also long to hear from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Sir, I shall proceed; and my next discourse shall be rather a
      Commendation, then a Justification of Angling: for, in my judgment, if it
      deserves to be commended, it is more then justified; for some practices
      what may be justified, deserve no commendation: yet there are none that
      deserve commendation but may be justified.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now having said this much by way of preparation, I am next to tell
      you, that in ancient times a debate hath risen, (and it is not yet
      resolved) Whether <i>Contemplation</i> or <i>Action</i> be the chiefest
      thing wherin the happiness of a man doth most consist in this world?
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning which, some have maintained their opinion of the first, by
      saying, "[That the nearer we Mortals come to God by way of imitation, the
      more happy we are:]" And that God injoyes himself only by <i>Contemplation</i>
      of his own <i>Goodness, Eternity, Infiniteness</i>, and <i>Power</i>, and
      the like; and upon this ground many of them prefer <i>Contemplation</i>
      before <i>Action</i>: and indeed, many of the Fathers seem to approve this
      opinion, as may appear in their Comments upon the words of our Saviour to
      <i>Martha</i>. [Luk. 10. 41, 42]
    </p>
    <p>
      And contrary to these, others of equal Authority and credit, have
      preferred <i>Action</i> to be chief; as experiments in <i>Physick</i>, and
      the application of it, both for the ease and prolongation of mans life, by
      which man is enabled to act, and to do good to others: And they say also,
      That <i>Action</i> is not only Doctrinal, but a maintainer of humane
      Society; and for these, and other reasons, to be preferr'd before <i>Contemplation</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning which two opinions, I shall forbear to add a third, by
      declaring my own, and rest my self contented in telling you (my worthy
      friend) that both these meet together, and do most properly belong to the
      most honest, ingenious, harmless Art of Angling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And first I shall tel you what some have observed, and I have found in my
      self, That the very sitting by the Rivers side, is not only the fittest
      place for, but will invite the Angler to Contemplation: That it is the
      fittest place, seems to be witnessed by the children of <i>Israel</i>,
      [Psal. 137.] who having banish'd all mirth and Musick from their pensive
      hearts, and having hung up their then mute Instruments upon the Willow
      trees, growing by the Rivers of <i>Babylon</i>, sate down upon those banks
      bemoaning the <i>ruines of Sion</i>, and contemplating their own sad
      condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      And an ingenuous <i>Spaniard</i> sayes, "[That both Rivers, and the
      inhabitants of the watery Element, were created for wise men to
      contemplate, and fools to pass by without consideration.]" And though I am
      too wise to rank myself in the first number, yet give me leave to free my
      self from the last, by offering to thee a short contemplation, first of
      Rivers, and then of Fish: concerning which, I doubt not but to relate to
      you many things very considerable. Concerning Rivers, there be divers
      wonders reported of them by Authors, of such credit, that we need not deny
      them an Historical faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of a River in <i>Epirus</i>, that puts out any lighted Torch, and
      kindles any Torch that was not lighted. Of the River <i>Selarus</i>, that
      in a few hours turns a rod or a wand into stone (and our <i>Camden</i>
      mentions the like wonder in <i>England</i>:) that there is a River in <i>Arabia</i>,
      of which all the Sheep that drink thereof have their Wool turned into a
      Vermilion colour. And one of no less credit then <i>Aristotle</i>, [in his
      Wonders of nature, this is confirmed by <i>Ennius</i> and <i>Solon</i> in
      his holy History.] tels us of a merry River, the River <i>Elusina</i>,
      that dances at the noise of Musick, that with Musick it bubbles, dances,
      and growes sandy, but returns to a wonted calmness and clearness when the
      Musick ceases. And lastly, (for I would not tire your patience) <i>Josephus</i>,
      that learned <i>Jew</i>, tells us of a River in <i>Judea</i>, that runs
      and moves swiftly all the six dayes of the week, and stands still and
      rests upon their <i>Sabbath</i> day. But Sir, lest this discourse may seem
      tedious, I shall give it a sweet conclusion out of that holy Poet Mr. <i>George
      Herbert</i> his Divine Contemplation on Gods providence.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Lord, who hath praise enough, nay, who hath any?
   None can express thy works, but he that knows them:
   And none can know thy works, they are so many,
   And so complete, but only he that owes them.

   We all acknowledge both thy power and love
   To be exact, transcendent, and divine;
   Who does so strangely, and so sweetly move,
   Whilst all things have their end, yet none but thine.

   Wherefore, most Sacred Spirit, I here present
   For me, and all my fellows praise to thee:
   And just it is that I should pay the rent,
   Because the benefit accrues to me.
</pre>
    <p>
      And as concerning <i>Fish</i>, in that Psalm [Psal. 104], wherein, for
      height of Poetry and Wonders, the Prophet <i>David</i> seems even to
      exceed himself; how doth he there express himselfe in choice Metaphors,
      even to the amazement of a contemplative Reader, concerning the Sea, the
      Rivers, and the Fish therein contained. And the great Naturallist <i>Pliny</i>
      sayes, "[That Natures great and wonderful power is more demonstrated in
      the Sea, then on the Land.]" And this may appear by the numerous and
      various Creatures, inhabiting both in and about that Element: as to the
      Readers of <i>Gesner, Randelitius, Pliny, Aristotle</i>, and others is
      demonstrated: But I will sweeten this discourse also out of a
      contemplation in Divine <i>Dubartas</i>, who sayes [in the fifth day],
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   <i>God quickened in the Sea and in the Rivers,
   So many fishes of so many features,
   That in the waters we may see all Creatures;
   Even all that on the earth is to be found,
   As if the world were in deep waters drownd.
   For seas (as well as Skies) have Sun, Moon, Stars;
   (As wel as air) Swallows, Rooks, and Stares;
   (As wel as earth) Vines, Roses, Nettles, Melons,
   Mushrooms, Pinks, Gilliflowers and many milions
   Of other plants, more rare, more strange then these;
   As very fishes living in the seas;
   And also Rams, Calves, Horses, Hares and Hogs,
   Wolves, Urchins, Lions, Elephants and Dogs;
   Yea, Men and Maids, and which I most admire,
   The Mitred Bishop, and the cowled Fryer.
   Of which examples but a few years since,
   Were shewn the</i> Norway <i>and</i> Polonian <i>Prince</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      These seem to be wonders, but have had so many confirmations from men of
      Learning and credit, that you need not doubt them; nor are the number, nor
      the various shapes of fishes, more strange or more fit for contemplation,
      then their different natures, inclinations and actions: concerning which I
      shall beg your patient ear a little longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Cuttle-fish</i> wil cast a long gut out of her throat, which (like
      as an Angler does his line) she sendeth, forth and pulleth in again at her
      pleasure, according as she sees some little fish come neer to her [Mount
      <i>Elsayes</i>: and others affirm this]; and the <i>Cuttle-fish</i> (being
      then hid in the gravel) lets the smaller fish nibble and bite the end of
      it; at which time shee by little and little draws the smaller fish so neer
      to her, that she may leap upon her, and then catches and devours her: and
      for this reason some have called this fish the <i>Sea-Angler</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also lustful and chaste fishes, of which I shall also give you
      examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      And first, what <i>Dubartas</i> sayes of a fish called the <i>Sargus</i>;
      which (because none can express it better then he does) I shall give you
      in his own words, supposing it shall not have the less credit for being
      Verse, for he hath gathered this, and other observations out of Authors
      that have been great and industrious searchers into the secrets of nature.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   <i>The Adulterous</i> Sargus <i>doth not only change,
   Wives every day in the deep streams, but (strange)
   As if the honey of Sea-love delight
   Could not suffice his ranging appetite,
   Goes courting</i> She-Goats <i>on the grassie shore,
   Horning their husbands that had horns before</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      And the same Author writes concerning the <i>Cantharus</i>, that which you
      shall also heare in his own words.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   <i>But contrary, the constant</i> Cantharus,
   <i>Is ever constant to his faithful Spouse,
   In nuptial duties spending his chaste life,
   Never loves any but his own dear wife</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sir, but a little longer, and I have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Sir, take what liberty you think fit, for your discourse
      seems to be Musick, and charms me into an attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Why then Sir, I will take a little libertie to tell, or
      rather to remember you what is said of <i>Turtle Doves</i>: First, that
      they silently plight their troth and marry; and that then, the Survivor
      scorns (as the <i>Thracian</i> women are said to do) to out-live his or
      her Mate; and this is taken for such a truth, that if the Survivor shall
      ever couple with another, the he or she, not only the living, but the
      dead, is denyed the name and honour of a true <i>Turtle Dove</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to parallel this Land Variety &amp; teach mankind moral faithfulness
      &amp; to condemn those that talk of Religion, and yet come short of the
      moral faith of fish and fowl; Men that violate the Law, affirm'd by Saint
      <i>Paul</i> [Rom. 2.14.15] to be writ in their hearts, and which he sayes
      shal at the last day condemn and leave them without excuse. I pray hearken
      to what <i>Dubartas</i> sings [5. day.] (for the hearing of such conjugal
      faithfulness, will be Musick to all chaste ears) and therefore, I say,
      hearken to what <i>Dubartas</i> sings of the <i>Mullet</i>:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   <i>But for chaste love the</i> Mullet <i>hath no peer,
   For, if the Fisher hath surprised her pheer,
   As mad with woe to shoare she followeth,
   Prest to consort him both in life and death</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      On the contrary, what shall I say of the <i>House-Cock</i>, which treads
      any Hen, and then (contrary to the <i>Swan</i>, the <i>Partridg</i>, and
      <i>Pigeon</i>) takes no care to hatch, to feed, or to cherish his own
      Brood, but is sensless though they perish.
    </p>
    <p>
      And 'tis considerable, that the <i>Hen</i> (which because she also takes
      any <i>Cock</i>, expects it not) who is sure the Chickens be her own, hath
      by a moral impression her care, and affection to her own Broode, more then
      doubled, even to such a height, that our Saviour in expressing his love to
      <i>Jerusalem</i>, [Mat. 23. 37] quotes her for an example of tender
      affection, as his Father had done <i>Job</i> for a pattern of patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to parallel this <i>Cock</i>, there be divers fishes that cast their
      spawne on flags or stones, and then leave it uncovered and exposed to
      become a prey, and be devoured by Vermine or other fishes: but other
      fishes (as namely the <i>Barbel</i>) take such care for the preservation
      of their seed, that (unlike to the <i>Cock</i> or the <i>Cuckoe</i>) they
      mutually labour (both the Spawner, and the Melter) to cover their spawne
      with sand, or watch it, or hide it in some secret place unfrequented by
      Vermine, or by any fish but themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir, these examples may, to you and others, seem strange; but they are
      testified, some by <i>Aristotle</i>, some by <i>Pliny</i>, some by <i>Gesner</i>,
      and by divers others of credit, and are believed and known by divers, both
      of wisdom and experience, to be a truth; and are (as I said at the
      beginning) fit for the contemplation of a most serious, and a most pious
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that they be fit for the contemplation of the most prudent and pious,
      and peaceable men, seems to be testified by the practice of so many devout
      and contemplative men; as the Patriarks or Prophets of old, and of the
      Apostles of our Saviour in these later times, of which twelve he chose
      four that were Fishermen: concerning which choice some have made these
      Observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, That he never reproved these for their Imployment or Calling, as he
      did the Scribes and the Mony-Changers. And secondly, That he found the
      hearts of such men, men that by nature were fitted for contemplation and
      quietness; men of mild, and sweet, and peaceable spirits, (as indeed most
      Anglers are) these men our blessed Saviour (who is observed to love to
      plant grace in good natures) though nothing be too hard for him, yet these
      men he chose to call from their irreprovable imployment, and gave them
      grace to be his Disciples and to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is observable, that it was our Saviours will that his four
      Fishermen Apostles should have a prioritie of nomination in the catalogue
      of his twelve Apostles, as namely first, S. <i>Peter, Andrew, James</i>
      [Mat. 10.] and <i>John</i>, and then the rest in their order.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is yet more observable, that when our blessed Saviour went up into
      the Mount, at his Transfiguration, when he left the rest of his Disciples
      and chose onely three to bear him company, that these three were all
      Fishermen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And since I have your promise to hear me with patience, I will take a
      liberty to look back upon an observation that hath been made by an
      ingenuous and learned man, who observes that God hath been pleased to
      allow those whom he himselfe hath appointed, to write his holy will in
      holy Writ, yet to express his will in such Metaphors as their former
      affections or practise had inclined them to; and he brings <i>Solomon</i>
      for an example, who before his conversion was remarkably amorous, and
      after by Gods appointment, writ that Love-Song [the Canticles] betwixt God
      and his Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if this hold in reason (as I see none to the contrary) then it may be
      probably concluded, that <i>Moses</i> (whom I told you before, writ the
      book of <i>Job</i>) and the Prophet <i>Amos</i> were both Anglers, for you
      shal in all the old Testaments find fish-hooks but twice mentioned;
      namely, by meek <i>Moses</i>, the friend of God; and by the humble Prophet
      <i>Amos</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning which last, namely, the Prophet <i>Amos</i>, I shall make but
      this Observation, That he that shall read the humble, lowly, plain stile
      of that Prophet, and compare it with the high, glorious, eloquent stile of
      the prophet <i>Isaiah</i> (though they be both equally true) may easily
      believe him to be a good natured, plaine Fisher-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which I do the rather believe, by comparing the affectionate, lowly,
      humble epistles of S. <i>Peter</i>, S. <i>James</i> and S. <i>John</i>,
      whom we know were Fishers, with the glorious language and high Metaphors
      of S. <i>Paul</i>, who we know was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me give you the example of two men more, that have lived nearer to our
      own times: first of Doctor <i>Nowel</i> sometimes Dean of S. <i>Paul's</i>,
      (in which Church his Monument stands yet undefaced) a man that in the
      Reformation of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> (not that of <i>Henry the VIII</i>.)
      was so noted for his meek spirit, deep Learning, Prudence and Piety, that
      the then Parliament and Convocation, both chose, injoyned, and trusted him
      to be the man to make a Catechism for publick use, such a one as should
      stand as a rule for faith and manners to their posteritie: And the good
      man (though he was very learned, yet knowing that God leads us not to
      heaven by hard questions) made that good, plain, unperplext Catechism,
      that is printed with the old Service Book. I say, this good man was as
      dear a lover, and constant practicer of Angling, as any Age can produce;
      and his custome was to spend (besides his fixt hours of prayer, those
      hours which by command of the Church were enjoined the old Clergy, and
      voluntarily dedicated to devotion by many Primitive Christians:) besides
      those hours, this good man was observed to spend, or if you will, to
      bestow a tenth part of his time in Angling; and also (for I have conversed
      with those which have conversed with him) to bestow a tenth part of his
      Revenue, and all his fish, amongst the poor that inhabited near to those
      Rivers in which it was caught, saying often, <i>That Charity gave life to
      Religion</i>: and at his return would praise God he had spent that day
      free from worldly trouble, both harmlesly and in a Recreation that became
      a Church-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      My next and last example shall be that undervaluer of money, the late
      Provost of <i>Eaton Colledg</i>, Sir <i>Henry Wotton</i>, (a man with whom
      I have often fish'd and convers'd) a man whose forraign imployments in the
      service of this Nation, and whose experience, learning, wit and
      cheerfulness, made his company to be esteemed one of the delights of
      mankind; this man, whose very approbation of Angling were sufficient to
      convince any modest Censurer of it, this man was also a most dear lover,
      and a frequent practicer of the Art of Angling, of which he would say,
      "['Twas an imployment for his idle time, which was not idly spent;]" for
      Angling was after tedious study "[A rest to his mind, a cheerer of his
      spirits, a divertion of sadness, a calmer of unquiet thoughts, a Moderator
      of passions, a procurer of contentedness, and that it begot habits of
      peace and patience in those that profest and practic'd it.]"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir, This was the saying of that Learned man; and I do easily believe that
      peace, and patience, and a calm content did cohabit in the cheerful heart
      of Sir <i>Henry Wotton</i>, because I know, that when he was beyond
      seventy years of age he made this description of a part of the present
      pleasure that possest him, as he sate quietly in a Summers evening on a
      bank a fishing; it is a description of the Spring, which because it glides
      as soft and sweetly from his pen, as that River does now by which it was
      then made, I shall repeat unto you.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

      <i>Viat</i>. Gentleman Huntsman, where found you this <i>Otter</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Hunt</i>. Marry (Sir) we found her a mile off this place a fishing; she
      has this morning eaten the greatest part of this <i>Trout</i>, she has
      only left thus much of it as you see, and was fishing for more; when we
      came we found her just at it: but we were here very early, we were here an
      hour before Sun-rise, and have given her no rest since we came: sure she'l
      hardly escape all these dogs and men. I am to have the skin if we kill
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Why, Sir, whats the skin worth?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Hunt</i>. 'Tis worth ten shillings to make gloves; the gloves of an <i>Otter</i>
      are the best fortification for your hands against wet weather that can be
      thought of.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. I pray, honest Huntsman, let me ask you a pleasant question,
      Do you hunt a Beast or a fish?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>H</i>. Sir, It is not in my power to resolve you; for the question has
      been debated among many great Clerks, and they seem to differ about it;
      but most agree, that his tail is fish: and if his body be fish too, then I
      may say, that a fish will walk upon land (for an <i>Otter</i> does so)
      sometimes five or six, or ten miles in a night. But (Sir) I can tell you
      certainly, that he devours much fish, and kils and spoils much more: And I
      can tell you, that he can smel a fish in the water one hundred yards from
      him (<i>Gesner</i> sayes, much farther) and that his stones are good
      against the Falling-sickness: and that there is an herb <i>Benione</i>,
      which being hung in a linen cloth near a Fish Pond, or any haunt that he
      uses, makes him to avoid the place, which proves he can smell both by
      water and land. And thus much for my knowledg of the <i>Otter</i>, which
      you may now see above water at vent, and the dogs close with him; I now
      see he will not last long, follow therefore my Masters, follow, for <i>Sweetlips</i>
      was like to have him at this vent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>via</i>. Oh me, all the Horse are got over the river, what shall we do
      now?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Hun</i>. Marry, stay a little &amp; follow, both they and the dogs will
      be suddenly on this side again, I warrant you, and the <i>Otter</i> too it
      may be: now have at him with <i>Kil buck</i>, for he vents again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>via</i>. Marry so he is, for look he vents in that corner. Now, now <i>Ringwood</i>
      has him. Come bring him to me. Look, 'tis a Bitch <i>Otter</i> upon my
      word, and she has lately whelped, lets go to the place where she was put
      down, and not far from it, you will find all her young ones, I dare
      warrant you: and kill them all too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Hunt</i>. Come Gentlemen, come all, lets go to the place where we put
      downe the <i>Otter</i>; look you, hereabout it was that shee kennell'd;
      look you, here it was indeed, for here's her young ones, no less then
      five: come lets kill them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. No, I pray Sir; save me one, and I'll try if I can make her
      tame, as I know an ingenuous Gentleman in <i>Leicester-shire</i> has done;
      who hath not only made her tame, but to catch fish, and doe many things of
      much pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Hunt</i>. Take one with all my heart; but let us kill the rest. And now
      lets go to an honest Alehouse and sing <i>Old Rose</i>, and rejoice all of
      us together.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Come my friend, let me invite you along with us; I'll bear
      your charges this night, and you shall beare mine to morrow; for my
      intention is to accompany you a day or two in fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Sir, your request is granted, and I shall be right glad, both
      to exchange such a courtesie, and also to enjoy your company.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Well, now lets go to your sport of Angling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Lets be going with all my heart, God keep you all, Gentlemen,
      and send you meet this day with another bitch <i>Otter</i>, and kill her
      merrily, and all her young ones too.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Now <i>Piscator</i>, where wil you begin to fish?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. We are not yet come to a likely place, I must walk a mile
      further yet before I begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Well then, I pray, as we walk, tell me freely how you like my
      Hoste, and the company? is not mine Hoste a witty man?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Sir, To speak truly, he is not to me; for most of his
      conceits were either Scripture-jests, or lascivious jests; for which I
      count no man witty: for the Divel will help a man that way inclin'd, to
      the first, and his own corrupt nature (which he alwayes carries with him)
      to the latter. But a companion that feasts the company with wit and mirth,
      and leaves out the sin (which is usually mixt with them) he is the man:
      and indeed, such a man should have his charges born: and to such company I
      hope to bring you this night; for at <i>Trout-Hal</i>, not far from this
      place, where I purpose to lodg to night, there is usually an Angler that
      proves good company.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for such discourse as we heard last night, it infects others; the very
      boyes will learn to talk and swear as they heard mine Host, and another of
      the company that shall be nameless; well, you know what example is able to
      do, and I know what the Poet sayes in the like case:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &mdash;&mdash;<i>Many a one
   Owes to his Country his Religion:
   And in another would as strongly grow,
   Had but his Nurse or Mother taught him so</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      This is reason put into Verse, and worthy the consideration of a wise man.
      But of this no more, for though I love civility, yet I hate severe
      censures: I'll to my own Art, and I doubt not but at yonder tree I shall
      catch a <i>Chub</i>, and then we'll turn to an honest cleanly Alehouse
      that I know right well, rest our selves, and dress it for our dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>via</i>. Oh, Sir, a <i>Chub</i> is the worst fish that swims, I hoped
      for a <i>Trout</i> for my dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pis</i>. Trust me, Sir, there is not a likely place for a <i>Trout</i>
      hereabout, and we staid so long to take our leave of your Huntsmen this
      morning, that the Sun is got so high, and shines so clear, that I will not
      undertake the catching of a <i>Trout</i> till evening; and though a <i>Chub</i>
      be by you and many others reckoned the worst of all fish, yet you shall
      see I'll make it good fish by dressing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Why, how will you dress him?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. I'll tell you when I have caught him: look you here, Sir, do
      you see? (but you must stand very close) there lye upon the top of the
      water twenty <i>Chubs</i>: I'll catch only one, and that shall be the
      biggest of them all: and that I will do so, I'll hold you twenty to one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. I marry, Sir, now you talk like an Artist, and I'll say, you
      are one, when I shall see you perform what you say you can do; but I yet
      doubt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. And that you shall see me do presently; look, the biggest of
      these <i>Chubs</i> has had some bruise upon his tail, and that looks like
      a white spot; that very <i>Chub</i> I mean to catch; sit you but down in
      the shade, and stay but a little while, and I'll warrant you I'll bring
      him to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. I'll sit down and hope well, because you seem to be so
      confident.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Look you Sir, there he is, that very <i>Chub</i> that I
      shewed you, with the white spot on his tail; and I'll be as certain to
      make him a good dish of meat, as I was to catch him. I'll now lead you to
      an honest Alehouse, where we shall find a cleanly room, Lavender in the
      windowes, and twenty Ballads stuck about the wall; there my Hostis (which
      I may tell you, is both cleanly and conveniently handsome) has drest many
      a one for me, and shall now dress it after my fashion, and I warrant it
      good meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Come Sir, with all my heart, for I begin to be hungry, and
      long to be at it, and indeed to rest my self too; for though I have walked
      but four miles this morning, yet I begin to be weary; yester dayes hunting
      hangs stil upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Wel Sir, and you shal quickly be at rest, for yonder is the
      house I mean to bring you to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come Hostis, how do you? wil you first give us a cup of your best Ale, and
      then dress this <i>Chub</i>, as you drest my last, when I and my friend
      were hereabout eight or ten daies ago? but you must do me one courtesie,
      it must be done instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Host</i>. I wil do it, Mr. <i>Piscator</i>, and with all the speed I
      can.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Now Sir, has not my Hostis made haste? And does not the fish
      look lovely?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Both, upon my word Sir, and therefore lets say Grace and fall
      to eating of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Well Sir, how do you like it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Trust me, 'tis as good meat as ever I tasted: now let me
      thank you for it, drink to you, and beg a courtesie of you; but it must
      not be deny'd me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. What is it, I pray Sir? You are so modest, that me thinks I
      may promise to grant it before it is asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Why Sir, it is that from henceforth you wil allow me to call
      you Master, and that really I may be your Scholer, for you are such a
      companion, and have so quickly caught, and so excellently cook'd this
      fish, as makes me ambitious to be your scholer.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Give me your hand: from this time forward I wil be your
      Master, and teach you as much of this Art as I am able; and will, as you
      desire me, tel you somewhat of the nature of some of the fish which we are
      to Angle for; and I am sure I shal tel you more then every Angler yet
      knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      And first I will tel you how you shall catch such a <i>Chub</i> as this
      was; &amp; then how to cook him as this was: I could not have begun to
      teach you to catch any fish more easily then this fish is caught; but then
      it must be this particular way, and this you must do:
    </p>
    <p>
      Go to the same hole, where in most hot days you will finde floting neer
      the top of the water, at least a dozen or twenty <i>Chubs</i>; get a <i>Grashopper</i>
      or two as you goe, and get secretly behinde the tree, put it then upon
      your hook, and let your hook hang a quarter of a yard short of the top of
      the water, and 'tis very likely that the shadow of your rod, which you
      must rest on the tree, will cause the <i>Chubs</i> to sink down to the
      bottom with fear; for they be a very fearful fish, and the shadow of a
      bird flying over them will make them do so; but they will presently rise
      up to the top again, and there lie soaring till some shadow affrights them
      again: when they lie upon the top of the water, look out the best <i>Chub</i>,
      which you setting your self in a fit place, may very easily do, and move
      your Rod as softly as a Snail moves, to that <i>Chub</i> you intend to
      catch; let your bait fall gently upon the water three or four inches
      before him, and he will infallibly take the bait, and you will be as sure
      to catch him; for he is one of the leather-mouth'd fishes, of which a hook
      does scarce ever lose his hold: and therefore give him play enough before
      you offer to take him out of the water. Go your way presently, take my
      rod, and doe as I bid you, and I will sit down and mend my tackling till
      you return back.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Truly, my loving Master, you have offered me as fair as I
      could wish: Ile go, and observe your directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look you, Master, what I have done; that which joyes my heart; caught just
      such another <i>Chub</i> as yours was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Marry, and I am glad of it: I am like to have a towardly
      Scholar of you. I now see, that with advice and practice you will make an
      Angler in a short time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. But Master, What if I could not have found a <i>Grashopper</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pis</i>. Then I may tell you, that a black <i>Snail</i>, with his belly
      slit, to shew his white; or a piece of soft cheese will usually do as
      well; nay, sometimes a <i>worm</i>, or any kind of <i>fly</i>; as the <i>Ant-fly</i>,
      the <i>Flesh-fly</i>, or <i>Wall-fly</i>, or the <i>Dor</i> or <i>Beetle</i>,
      (which you may find under a Cow-turd) or a <i>Bob</i>, which you will find
      in the same place, and in time wil be a <i>Beetle</i>; it is a short white
      worm, like to, and bigger then a Gentle, or a <i>Cod-worm</i>, or <i>Case-worm</i>:
      any of these will do very wel to fish in such a manner. And after this
      manner you may catch a <i>Trout</i>: in a hot evening, when as you walk by
      a Brook, and shal see or hear him leap at Flies, then if you get a <i>Grashopper</i>,
      put it on your hook, with your line about two yards long, standing behind
      a bush or tree where his hole is, and make your bait stir up and down on
      the top of the water; you may, if you stand close, be sure of a bit, but
      not sure to catch him, for he is not a leather mouthed fish: and after
      this manner you may fish for him with almost any kind of live Flie, but
      especially with a <i>Grashopper</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. But before you go further, I pray good Master, what mean you
      by a leather mouthed fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. By a leather mouthed fish, I mean such as have their teeth in
      their throat, as the <i>Chub</i> or <i>Cheven</i>, and so the <i>Barbel</i>,
      the <i>Gudgion</i> and <i>Carp</i>, and divers others have; and the hook
      being stuck into the leather or skin of such fish, does very seldome or
      never lose its hold: But on the contrary, a <i>Pike</i>, a <i>Pearch</i>,
      or <i>Trout</i>, and so some other fish, which have not their teeth in
      their throats, but in their mouthes, which you shal observe to be very
      full of bones, and the skin very thin, and little of it: I say, of these
      fish the hook never takes so sure hold, but you often lose the fish unless
      he have gorg'd it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. I thank you good Master for this observation; but now what
      shal be done with my <i>Chub</i> or <i>Cheven</i> that I have caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Marry Sir, it shall be given away to some poor body, for Ile
      warrant you Ile give you a <i>Trout</i> for your supper; and it is a good
      beginning of your Art to offer your first fruits to the poor, who will
      both thank God and you for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now lets walk towards the water again, and as I go Ile tel you when
      you catch your next <i>Chub</i>, how to dresse it as this was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Come (good Master) I long to be going and learn your
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. You must dress it, or see it drest thus: When you have scaled
      him, wash him very cleane, cut off his tail and fins; and wash him not
      after you gut him, but chine or cut him through the middle as a salt fish
      is cut, then give him four or five scotches with your knife, broil him
      upon wood-cole or char-cole; but as he is broiling; baste him often with
      butter that shal be choicely good; and put good store of salt into your
      butter, or salt him gently as you broil or baste him; and bruise or cut
      very smal into your butter, a little Time, or some other sweet herb that
      is in the Garden where you eat him: thus used, it takes away the watrish
      taste which the <i>Chub</i> or <i>Chevin</i> has, and makes him a choice
      dish of meat, as you your self know, for thus was that dressed, which you
      did eat of to your dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or you may (for variety) dress a <i>Chub</i> another way, and you will
      find him very good, and his tongue and head almost as good as a <i>Carps</i>;
      but then you must be sure that no grass or weeds be left in his mouth or
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus you must dress him: Slit him through the middle, then cut him into
      four pieces: then put him into a pewter dish, and cover him with another,
      put into him as much White Wine as wil cover him, or Spring water and
      Vinegar, and store of Salt, with some branches of Time, and other sweet
      herbs; let him then be boiled gently over a Chafing-dish with wood coles,
      and when he is almost boiled enough, put half of the liquor from him, not
      the top of it; put then into him a convenient quantity of the best butter
      you can get, with a little Nutmeg grated into it, and sippets of white
      bread: thus ordered, you wil find the <i>Chevin</i> and the sauce too, a
      choice dish of meat: And I have been the more careful to give you a
      perfect direction how to dress him, because he is a fish undervalued by
      many, and I would gladly restore him to some of his credit which he has
      lost by ill Cookery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. But Master, have you no other way to catch a <i>Cheven</i>,
      or <i>Chub</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Yes that I have, but I must take time to tel it you
      hereafter; or indeed, you must learn it by observation and practice,
      though this way that I have taught you was the easiest to catch a <i>Chub</i>,
      at this time, and at this place. And now we are come again to the River; I
      wil (as the Souldier sayes) prepare for skirmish; that is, draw out my
      Tackling, and try to catch a <i>Trout</i> for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Trust me Master, I see now it is a harder matter to catch a
      <i>Trout</i> then a <i>Chub</i>; for I have put on patience, and followed
      you this two hours, and not seen a fish stir, neither at your Minnow nor
      your worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Wel Scholer, you must indure worse luck sometime, or you will
      never make a good Angler. But what say you now? there is a <i>Trout</i>
      now, and a good one too, if I can but hold him; and two or three turns
      more will tire him: Now you see he lies still, and the sleight is to land
      him: Reach me that Landing net: So (Sir) now he is mine own, what say you?
      is not this worth all my labour?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. On my word Master, this is a gallant <i>Trout</i>; what shall
      we do with him?
    </p>
    <p class="toc">
      <a name="linktrout" id="trout"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%"> <img alt="trout (27K)" src="images/trout.jpg"
       width="100%" /></div>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Marry ee'n eat him to supper: We'l go to my Hostis, from
      whence we came; she told me, as I was going out of door, that my brother
      <i>Peter</i>, a good Angler, and a cheerful companion, had sent word he
      would lodg there to night, and bring a friend with him. My Hostis has two
      beds, and I know you and I may have the best: we'l rejoice with my brother
      <i>Peter</i> and his friend, tel tales, or sing Ballads, or make a Catch,
      or find some harmless sport to content us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. A match, good Master, lets go to that house, for the linen
      looks white, and smels of Lavender, and I long to lye in a pair of sheets
      that smels so: lets be going, good Master, for I am hungry again with
      fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Nay, stay a little good Scholer, I caught my last <i>Trout</i>
      with a worm, now I wil put on a Minow and try a quarter of an hour about
      yonder trees for another, and so walk towards our lodging. Look you
      Scholer, thereabout we shall have a bit presently, or not at all: Have
      with you (Sir!) on my word I have him. Oh it is a great logger-headed <i>Chub</i>:
      Come, hang him upon that Willow twig, and let's be going. But turn out of
      the way a little, good Scholer, towards yonder high hedg: We'l sit whilst
      this showr falls so gently upon the teeming earth, and gives a sweeter
      smel to the lovely flowers that adorn the verdant Meadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look, under that broad <i>Beech tree</i> I sate down when I was last this
      way a fishing, and the birds in the adjoining Grove seemed to have a
      friendly contention with an Echo, whose dead voice seemed to live in a
      hollow cave, near to the brow of that Primrose hil; there I sate viewing
      the Silver streams glide silently towards their center, the tempestuous
      Sea, yet sometimes opposed by rugged roots, and pibble stones, which broke
      their waves, and turned them into some: and sometimes viewing the harmless
      Lambs, some leaping securely in the cool shade, whilst others sported
      themselvs in the cheerful Sun; and others were craving comfort from the
      swolne Udders of their bleating Dams. As I thus sate, these and other
      sighs had so fully possest my soul, that I thought as the Poet has happily
      exprest it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   <i>I was for that time lifted above earth;
   And possest joyes not promis'd in my birth</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      As I left this place, and entered into the next field, a second pleasure
      entertained me, 'twas a handsome Milk-maid, that had cast away all care,
      and sung like a <i>Nightingale</i>; her voice was good, and the Ditty
      fitted for it; 'twas that smooth Song which was made by <i>Kit Marlow</i>,
      now at least fifty years ago; and the Milk maid's mother sung an answer to
      it, which was made by Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i> in his younger days.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were old fashioned Poetry, but choicely good, I think much better
      then that now in fashion in this Critical age. Look yonder, on my word,
      yonder they be both a milking again: I will give her the <i>Chub</i>, and
      persuade them to sing those two songs to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. God speed, good woman, I have been a-fishing, and am going to
      <i>Bleak Hall</i> to my bed, and having caught more fish then will sup my
      self and friend, will bestow this upon you and your daughter for I use to
      sell none.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Milkw</i>. Marry, God requite you Sir, and we'l eat it cheerfully: will
      you drink a draught of red Cow's milk?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. No, I thank you: but I pray do us a courtesie that shal stand
      you and your daughter in nothing, and we wil think our selves stil
      something in your debt; it is but to sing us a Song, that that was sung by
      you and your daughter, when I last past over this Meadow, about eight or
      nine dayes since.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Milk</i>. what Song was it, I pray? was it, <i>Come Shepherds deck your
      heads</i>: or, <i>As at noon</i> Dulcina <i>rested</i>: or <i>Philida
      flouts me</i>?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. No, it is none of those: it is a Song that your daughter sung
      the first part, and you sung the answer to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Milk</i>. O I know it now, I learn'd the first part in my golden age,
      when I was about the age of my daughter; and the later part, which indeed
      fits me best, but two or three years ago; you shal, God willing, hear them
      both. Come <i>Maudlin</i>, sing the first part to the Gentlemen with a
      merrie heart, and Ile sing the second.
    </p>

   All these in me no means can move
   To come to thee, and be thy Love.

   But could youth last, and love stil breed,

   Then those delights my mind might move

    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Well sung, good woman, I thank you, I'l give you another dish
      of fish one of these dayes, and then beg another Song of you. Come

    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Piscat</i>. Wel met brother <i>Peter</i>, I heard you &amp; a friend
      would lodg here to night, and that has made me and my friend cast to lodge
      here too; my friend is one that would faine be a brother of the <i>Angle</i>:
      he has been an <i>Angler</i> but this day, and I have taught him how to
      catch a <i>Chub</i> with <i>daping</i> a <i>Grashopper</i>, and he has
      caught a lusty one of nineteen inches long. But I pray you brother, who is
      it that is your companion?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Peter</i>. Brother <i>Piscator</i>, my friend is an honest Country man,
      and his name is <i>Coridon</i>, a most downright witty merry companion
      that met me here purposely to eat a <i>Trout</i> and be pleasant, and I
      have not yet wet my line since I came from home: But I wil fit him to
      morrow with a <i>Trout</i> for his breakfast, if the weather be any thing
      like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Nay brother, you shall not delay him so long, for look you
      here is a <i>Trout</i> will fill six reasonable bellies. Come Hostis,
      dress it presently, and get us what other meat the house wil afford, and
      give us some good Ale, and lets be merrie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Description of a</i> Trout.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Peter</i>. On my word, this <i>Trout</i> is in perfect season. Come, I
      thank you, and here's a hearty draught to you, and to all the brothers of
      the Angle, wheresoever they be, and to my young brothers good fortune to
      morrow; I wil furnish him with a rod, if you wil furnish him with the rest
      of the tackling, we wil set him up and make him a fisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I wil tel him one thing for his encouragement, that his fortune hath
      made him happy to be a Scholer to such a Master; a Master that knowes as
      much both of the nature and breeding of fish, as any man; and can also
      tell him as well how to catch and cook them, from the <i>Minnow</i> to the
      <i>Sammon</i>, as any that I ever met withall.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Trust me, brother <i>Peter</i>, I find my Scholer to be so
      sutable to my own humour, which is to be free and pleasant, and civilly
      merry, that my resolution is to hide nothing from him. Believe me,
      Scholer, this is my resolution: and so here's to you a hearty draught, and
      to all that love us, and the honest Art of Angling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Trust me, good Master, you shall not sow your seed in barren
      ground, for I hope to return you an increase answerable to your hopes; but
      however, you shal find me obedient, and thankful, and serviceable to my
      best abilitie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. 'Tis enough, honest Scholer, come lets to supper. Come my
      friend <i>Coridon</i>, this <i>Trout</i> looks lovely, it was twenty two
      inches when it was taken, and the belly of it look'd some part of it as
      yellow as a Marygold, and part of it as white as a Lily, and yet me thinks
      it looks better in this good fawce.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Coridon</i>. Indeed, honest friend, it looks well, and tastes well, I
      thank you for it, and so does my friend <i>Peter</i>, or else he is to
      blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pet</i>. Yes, and so I do, we all thank you, and when we have supt, I
      wil get my friend <i>Coridon</i> to sing you a Song, for requital.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cor</i>. I wil sing a Song if anyboby wil sing another; else, to be
      plain with you, I wil sing none: I am none of those that sing for meat,
      but for company; I say, 'Tis merry in Hall when men sing all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. I'l promise you I'l sing a Song that was lately made at my
      request by Mr. <i>William Basse</i>, one that has made the choice Songs of
      the <i>Hunter in his carrere</i>, and of <i>Tom of Bedlam</i>, and many
      others of note; and this that I wil sing is in praise of Angling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cor</i>. And then mine shall be the praise of a Country mans life: What
      will the rest sing of?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pet</i>. I wil promise you I wil sing another Song in praise of
      Angling, to-morrow night, for we wil not part till then, but fish to
      morrow, and sup together, and the next day every man leave fishing, and
      fall to his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. 'Tis a match, and I wil provide you a Song or a Ketch against
      then too, that shal give some addition of mirth to the company; for we wil
      be merrie.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. 'Tis a match my masters; lets ev'n say Grace, and turn to the
      fire, drink the other cup to wet our whistles, and so sing away all sad
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come on my masters, who begins? I think it is best to draw cuts and avoid
      contention.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pet</i>. It is a match. Look, the shortest Cut fals to <i>Coridon</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cor</i>. Well then, I wil begin; for I hate contention.

        CORIDONS Song.

   <i>Oh the sweet contentment
   The country man doth find!
     high trolollie laliloe

   That quiet contemplation
   Possesseth all my mind</i>:

   <i>For Courts are full of flattery,
   As hath too oft been tri'd;
     high trolollie lollie loe
     high trolollie lee,
   The City full of wantonness,
   and both are full of pride</i>:
     Then care away,
     and wend along with me.

   <i>But oh the honest countryman
   Speaks truly from his heart,
     high trolollie lollie loe
     high trolollie lee,
   His pride is in his Tillage,
   his Horses and his Cart</i>:
     Then care away,
     and wend along with me.

   <i>Our clothing is good sheep skins
   Gray russet for our wives,
     high trolollie lollie loe

   'Tis warmth and not gay clothing
   that doth prolong our lives</i>:

   <i>The ploughman, though he labor hard,
   Yet on the</i> Holy-day,
     <i>high trolollie lollie loe

     Then come away, turn
     County man with me</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Well sung <i>Coridon</i>, this Song was sung with mettle, and
      it was choicely fitted to the occasion; I shall love you for it as long as
      I know you: I would you were a brother of the Angle, for a companion that
      is cheerful and free from swearing and scurrilous discourse, is worth
      gold. I love such mirth as does not make friends ashamed to look upon one
      another next morning; nor men (that cannot wel bear it) to repent the
      money they spend when they be warmed with drink: and take this for a rule,
      you may pick out such times and such companies, that you may make your
      selves merrier for a little then a great deal of money; for <i>'Tis the
      company and not the charge that makes the feast</i>: and such a companion
      you prove, I thank you for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I will not complement you out of the debt that I owe you, and
      therefore I will begin my Song, and wish it may be as well liked.

            The ANGLERS Song.

   <i>As inward love breeds outward talk,
   The</i> Hound <i>some praise, and some the</i> Hawk,
   <i>Some better pleas'd with private sport,
   Use</i> Tenis, <i>some a</i> Mistris <i>court:
     But these delights I neither wish,
     Nor envy, while I freely fish.

   Who</i> hunts, <i>doth oft in danger ride
   Who</i> hauks, <i>lures oft both far &amp; wide;
   Who uses games, may often prove
   A loser; but who fals in love,
     Is fettered in fond</i> Cupids <i>snare:
     My Angle breeds me no such care.

   Of Recreation there is none
   So free as fishing is alone;
   All other pastimes do no less
   Then mind and body both possess;
     My hand alone my work can do,
     So I can fish and study too.

   I care not, I, to fish in seas,
   Fresh rivers best my mind do please,
   Whose sweet calm course I contemplate;
   And seek in life to imitate;
     In civil bounds I fain would keep,
     And for my past offences weep.

   And when the timerous</i> Trout <i>I wait
   To take, and he devours my bait,
   How poor a thing sometimes I find
   Will captivate a greedy mind:
     And when none bite, I praise the wise,
     Whom vain alurements ne're surprise.

   But yet though while I fish, I fast,
   I make good fortune my repast,
   And there unto my friend invite,
   In whom I more then that delight:
     Who is more welcome to my dish,
     Then to my Angle was my fish.

   As well content no prize to take
   As use of taken prize to make;
   For so our Lord was pleased when
   He Fishers made Fishers of men;
     Where (which is in no other game)
     A man may fish and praise his name.

   The first men that our Saviour dear
   Did chuse to wait upon him here,
   Blest Fishers were; and fish the last
   Food was, that he on earth did taste.
     I therefore strive to follow those,
     Whom he to follow him hath chose.</i>

      <i>Pisc</i>. Good morrow good Hostis, I see my brother <i>Peter</i> is in
      bed still; Come, give my Scholer and me a cup of Ale, and be sure you get
      us a good dish of meat against supper, for we shall come hither as hungry
      as <i>Hawks</i>. Come Scholer, lets be going.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Good Master, as we walk towards the water, wil you be pleased
      to make the way seeme shorter by telling me first the nature of the <i>Trout</i>,
      and then how to catch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. My honest Scholer, I wil do it freely: The <i>Trout</i> (for
      which I love to angle above any fish) may be justly said (as the ancient
      Poets say of Wine, and we English say of Venson) to be a generous fish,
      because he has his seasons, a fish that comes in, and goes out with the <i>Stag</i>
      or <i>Buck</i>: and you are to observe, that as there be some <i>barren
      Does</i>, that are good in Summer; so there be some barren <i>Trouts</i>,
      that are good in Winter; but there are not many that are so, for usually
      they be in their perfection in the month of <i>May</i>, and decline with
      the <i>Buck</i>: Now you are to take notice, that in several Countries, as
      in <i>Germany</i> and in other parts compar'd to ours, they differ much in
      their bigness, shape, and other wayes, and so do <i>Trouts</i>; 'tis wel
      known that in the Lake <i>Lemon</i>, the Lake of <i>Geneva</i>, there are
      <i>Trouts</i> taken, of three Cubits long, as is affirmed by <i>Gesner</i>,
      a Writer of good credit: and <i>Mercator</i> sayes, the <i>Trouts</i> that
      are taken in the Lake of <i>Geneva</i>, are a great part of the
      Merchandize of that famous City. And you are further to know, that there
      be certaine waters that breed <i>Trouts</i> remarkable, both for their
      number and smalness&mdash;I know a little Brook in <i>Kent</i> that breeds
      them to a number incredible, and you may take them twentie or fortie in an
      hour, but none greater then about the size of a <i>Gudgion</i>. There are
      also in divers Rivers, especially that relate to, or be near to the Sea,
      (as <i>Winchester</i>, or the Thames about <i>Windsor</i>) a little <i>Trout</i>
      called a <i>Samlet</i> or <i>Skegger Trout</i> (in both which places I
      have caught twentie or fortie at a standing) that will bite as fast and as
      freely as <i>Minnows</i>; these be by some taken to be young <i>Salmons</i>,
      but in those waters they never grow to bee bigger then a <i>Herring</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also in <i>Kent</i>, neer to <i>Canterbury</i>, a <i>Trout</i>
      (called there a <i>Fordig Trout</i>) a <i>Trout</i> (that bears the name
      of the Town where 'tis usually caught) that is accounted rare meat, many
      of them near the bigness of a <i>Salmon</i>, but knowne by their different
      colour, and in their best season cut very white; and none have been known
      to be caught with an Angle, unless it were one that was caught by honest
      Sir <i>George Hastings</i>, an excellent Angler (and now with God) and he
      has told me, he thought that <i>Trout</i> bit not for hunger, but
      wantonness; and 'tis the rather to be believed, because both he then, and
      many others before him have been curious to search into their bellies what
      the food was by which they lived; and have found out nothing by which they
      might satisfie their curiositie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning which you are to take notice, that it is reported, there is a
      fish that hath not any mouth, but lives by taking breath by the porinss of
      her gils, and feeds and is nourish'd by no man knows what; and this may be
      believed of the <i>Fordig Trout</i>, which (as it is said of the <i>Stork</i>,
      that he knowes his season, so he) knows his times (I think almost his day)
      of coming into that River out of the Sea, where he lives (and it is like
      feeds) nine months of the year, and about three in the River of <i>Fordig</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now for some confirmation of this; you are to know, that this <i>Trout</i>
      is thought to eat nothing in the fresh water; and it may be the better
      believed, because it is well known, that <i>Swallowes</i>, which are not
      seen to flye in <i>England</i> for six months in the year, but about <i>Michaelmas</i>
      leave us for a hotter climate; yet some of them, that have been left
      behind their fellows, [view Sir Fra. Bacon exper. 899.], have been found
      (many thousand at a time) in hollow trees, where they have been observed
      to live and sleep [see Topsel of Frogs] out the whole winter without meat;
      and so <i>Albertus</i> observes that there is one kind of <i>Frog</i> that
      hath her mouth naturally shut up about the end of <i>August</i>, and that
      she lives so all the Winter, and though it be strange to some, yet it is
      known to too many amongst us to bee doubted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so much for these <i>Fordig Trouts</i>, which never afford an Angler
      sport, but either live their time of being in the fresh water by their
      meat formerly gotten in the Sea, (not unlike the <i>Swallow</i> or <i>Frog</i>)
      or by the vertue of the fresh water only, as the <i>Camelion</i> is said
      to live by the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also in <i>Northumberland</i>, a <i>Trout</i>, called a <i>Bull
      Trout</i>, of a much greater length and bignesse then any in these
      Southern parts; and there is in many Rivers that relate to the Sea, <i>Salmon
      Trouts</i> as much different one from another, both in shape and in their
      spots, as we see Sheep differ one from another in their shape and bigness,
      and in the finess of their wool: and certainly as some Pastures do breed
      larger Sheep, so do some Rivers, by reason of the ground over which they
      run, breed larger <i>Trouts</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the next thing that I will commend to your consideration is, That the
      <i>Trout</i> is of a more sudden growth then other fish: concerning which
      you are also to take notice, that he lives not so long as the <i>Pearch</i>
      and divers other fishes do, as Sir <i>Francis Bacon</i> hath observed in
      his History of life and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      And next, you are to take notice, that after hee is come to his full
      growth, he declines in his bodie, but keeps his bigness or thrives in his
      head till his death. And you are to know that he wil about (especially
      before) the time of his Spawning, get almost miraculously through <i>Weires</i>
      and <i>Floud-Gates</i> against the stream, even through such high and
      swift places as is almost incredible. Next, that the <i>Trout</i> usually
      Spawns about <i>October</i> or <i>November</i>, but in some Rivers a
      little sooner or later; which is the more observable, because most other
      fish Spawne in the Spring or Summer, when the Sun hath warmed both the
      earth and water, and made it fit for generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And next, you are to note, that till the Sun gets to such a height as to
      warm the earth and the water, the <i>Trout</i> is sick, and lean, and
      lowsie, and unwholsome: for you shall in winter find him to have a big
      head, and then to be lank, and thin, &amp; lean; at which time many of
      them have sticking on them Sugs, or <i>Trout</i> lice, which is a kind of
      a worm, in shape like a Clove or a Pin, with a big head, and sticks close
      to him and sucks his moisture; those I think the <i>Trout</i> breeds
      himselfe, and never thrives til he free himself from them, which is till
      warm weather comes, and then as he growes stronger, he gets from the dead,
      still water, into the sharp streames and the gravel, and there rubs off
      these worms or lice: and then as he grows stronger, so he gets him into
      swifter and swifter streams, and there lies at the watch for any flie or
      Minow that comes neer to him; and he especially loves the <i>May</i> flie,
      which is bred of the <i>Cod-worm</i> or <i>Caddis</i>; and these make the
      <i>Trout</i> bold and lustie, and he is usually fatter, and better meat at
      the end of that month, then at any time of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you are to know, that it is observed that usually the best <i>Trouts</i>
      are either red or yellow, though some be white and yet good; but that is
      not usual; and it is a note observable that the female <i>Trout</i> hath
      usually a less head and a deeper body then the male <i>Trout</i>; and a
      little head to any fish, either <i>Trout, Salmon</i>, or other fish, is a
      sign that that fish is in season.
    </p>
    <p>
      But yet you are to note, that as you see some Willows or Palm trees bud
      and blossome sooner then others do, so some <i>Trouts</i> be in some
      Rivers sooner in season; and as the Holly or Oak are longer before they
      cast their Leaves, so are some <i>Trouts</i> in some Rivers longer before
      they go out of season.

      CHAP. IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      And having told you these Observations concerning <i>Trouts</i>, I shall
      next tell you how to catch them: which is usually with a <i>Worm</i>, or a
      <i>Minnow</i> (which some call a <i>Penke</i>;) or with a <i>Flie</i>,
      either a <i>natural</i> or an <i>artificial</i> Flie: Concerning which
      three I wil give you some Observations and Directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Worms, there be very many sorts; some bred onely in the earth, as the
      <i>earth worm</i>; others amongst or of plants, as the <i>dug-worm</i>;
      and others in the bodies of living creatures; or some of dead flesh, as
      the <i>Magot</i> or <i>Gentle</i>, and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now these be most of them particularly good for particular fishes: but for
      the <i>Trout</i> the <i>dew-worm</i>, (which some also cal the <i>Lob-worm</i>)
      and the <i>Brandling</i> are the chief; and especially the first for a
      great <i>Trout</i>, and the later for a lesse. There be also of <i>lob-worms</i>,
      some called <i>squirel-tails</i> (a worm which has a red head, a streak
      down the back, and a broad tail) which are noted to be the best, because
      they are the toughest, and most lively, and live longest in the water: for
      you are to know, that a dead worm is but a dead bait, and like to catch
      nothing, compared to a lively, quick, stirring worm: And for a <i>Brandling</i>,
      hee is usually found in an old dunghil, or some very rotten place neer to
      it; but most usually in cow dung, or hogs dung, rather then horse dung,
      which is somewhat too hot and dry for that worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also divers other kindes of worms, which for colour and shape
      alter even as the ground out of which they are got: as the <i>marsh-worm</i>,
      the <i>tag-tail</i>, the <i>flag-worm</i>, the <i>dock-worm</i>, the <i>oake-worm</i>,
      the <i>gilt-tail</i>, and too many to name, even as many sorts, as some
      think there be of severall kinds of birds in the air: of which I shall say
      no more, but tell you, that what worms soever you fish with, are the
      better for being long kept before they be used; and in case you have not
      been so provident, then the way to cleanse and scoure them quickly, is to
      put them all night in water, if they be <i>Lob-worms</i>, and then put
      them into your bag with fennel: but you must not put your <i>Brandling</i>
      above an hour in water, and then put them into fennel for sudden use: but
      if you have time, and purpose to keep them long, then they be best
      preserved in an earthen pot with good store of <i>mosse</i>, which is to
      be fresh every week or eight dayes; or at least taken from them, and clean
      wash'd, and wrung betwixt your hands till it be dry, and then put it to
      them again: And for Moss you are to note, that there be divers kindes of
      it which I could name to you, but wil onely tel you, that that which is
      likest a <i>Bucks horn</i> is the best; except it be <i>white</i> Moss,
      which grows on some heaths, and is hard to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the <i>Minnow</i> or <i>Penke</i>, he is easily found and caught in
      April, for then hee appears in the Rivers: but Nature hath taught him to
      shelter and hide himself in the Winter in ditches that be neer to the
      River, and there both to hide and keep himself warm in the weeds, which
      rot not so soon as in a running River in which place if hee were in
      Winter, the distempered Floods that are usually in that season, would
      suffer him to have no rest, but carry him headlong to Mils and Weires to
      his confusion. And of these <i>Minnows</i>, first you are to know, that
      the biggest size is not the best; and next, that the middle size and the
      whitest are the best: and then you are to know, that I cannot well teach
      in words, but must shew you how to put it on your hook, that it may turn
      the better: And you are also to know, that it is impossible it should turn
      too quick: And you are yet to know, that in case you want a <i>Minnow</i>,
      then a small <i>Loch</i>, or a <i>Sticklebag</i>, or any other small Fish
      will serve as wel: And you are yet to know, that you may salt, and by that
      means keep them fit for use three or four dayes or longer; and that of
      salt, bay salt is the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for <i>Flies</i>, which is the third bait wherewith <i>Trouts</i> are
      usually taken. You are to know, that there are as many sorts of Flies as
      there be of Fruits: I will name you but some of them: as the <i>dun flie</i>,
      the <i>stone flie</i>, the <i>red flie</i>, the <i>moor flie</i>, the <i>tawny
      flie</i>, the <i>shel flie</i>, the <i>cloudy</i> or blackish <i>flie</i>:
      there be of Flies, <i>Caterpillars</i>, and <i>Canker flies</i>, and <i>Bear
      flies</i>; and indeed, too many either for mee to name, or for you to
      remember: and their breeding is so various and wonderful, that I might
      easily amaze my self, and tire you in a relation of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet I wil exercise your promised patience by saying a little of the <i>Caterpillar</i>,
      or the <i>Palmer flie</i> or <i>worm</i>; that by them you may guess what
      a work it were in a Discourse but to run over those very many <i>flies,
      worms</i>, and little living creatures with which the Sun and Summer adorn
      and beautifie the river banks and meadows; both for the recreation and
      contemplation of the Angler: and which (I think) I myself enjoy more then
      any other man that is not of my profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pliny</i> holds an opinion, that many have their birth or being from a
      dew that in the Spring falls upon the leaves of trees; and that some kinds
      of them are from a dew left upon herbs or flowers: and others from a dew
      left upon Colworts or Cabbages: All which kindes of dews being thickened
      and condensed, are by the Suns generative heat most of them hatch'd, and
      in three dayes made living creatures, and of several shapes and colours;
      some being hard and tough, some smooth and soft; some are horned in their
      head, some in their tail, some have none; some have hair, some none; some
      have sixteen feet, some less, and some have none: but (as our <i>Topsel</i>
      hath with great diligence observed) [in his <i>History</i> of Serpents.]
      those which have none, move upon the earth, or upon broad leaves, their
      motion being not unlike to the waves of the sea. Some of them hee also
      observes to be bred of the eggs of other Caterpillers: and that those in
      their time turn to be <i>Butter-flies</i>; and again, that their eggs turn
      the following yeer to be <i>Caterpillars</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tis endlesse to tell you what the curious Searchers into Natures
      productions, have observed of these Worms and Flies: But yet I shall tell
      you what our <i>Topsel</i> sayes of the <i>Canker</i>, or <i>Palmer-worm</i>,
      or <i>Caterpiller</i>; That wheras others content themselves to feed on
      particular herbs or leaves (for most think, those very leaves that gave
      them life and shape, give them a particular feeding and nourishment, and
      that upon them they usually abide;) yet he observes, that this is called a
      <i>Pilgrim</i> or <i>Palmer-worm</i>, for his very wandering life and
      various food; not contenting himself (as others do) with any certain place
      for his abode, nor any certain kinde of herb or flower for his feeding;
      but will boldly and disorderly wander up and down, and not endure to be
      kept to a diet, or fixt to a particular place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay, the very colours of <i>Caterpillers</i> are, as one has observed,
      very elegant and beautiful: I shal (for a taste of the rest) describe one
      of them, which I will sometime the next month, shew you feeding on a
      Willow tree, and you shal find him punctually to answer this very
      description: "His lips and mouth somewhat yellow, his eyes black as Jet,
      his ore-head purple, his feet and hinder parts green, his tail two forked
      and black, the whole body stain'd with a kind of red spots which run along
      the neck and shoulder-blades, not unlike the form of a Cross, or the
      letter X, made thus cross-wise, and a white line drawn down his back to
      his tail; all which add much beauty to his whole body." And it is to me
      observable, that at a fix'd age this <i>Caterpiller</i> gives over to eat,
      and towards winter comes to be coverd over with a strange shell or crust,
      and so lives a kind of dead life, without eating all the winter, and (as
      others of several kinds turn to be several kinds of flies and vermin, the
      Spring following) [view Sir <i>Fra. Bacon</i> exper. 728 &amp; 90 in his
      Natural History] so this <i>Caterpiller</i> then turns to be a painted
      Butterflye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come, come my Scholer, you see the River stops our morning walk, and I wil
      also here stop my discourse, only as we sit down under this Honey-Suckle
      hedge, whilst I look a Line to fit the Rod that our brother <i>Peter</i>
      has lent you, I shall for a little confirmation of what I have said,
      repeat the observation of the Lord <i>Bartas</i>.

      <i>Vi</i>. Oh my good Master, this morning walk has been spent to my great
      pleasure and wonder: but I pray, when shall I have your direction how to
      make Artificial flyes, like to those that the <i>Trout</i> loves best? and
      also how to use them?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. My honest Scholer, it is now past five of the Clock, we will
      fish til nine, and then go to Breakfast: Go you to yonder <i>Sycamore tree</i>,
      and hide your bottle of drink under the hollow root of it; for about that
      time, and in that place, we wil make a brave Breakfast with a piece of
      powdered Bief, and a Radish or two that I have in my Fish-bag; we shall, I
      warrant you, make a good, honest, wholsome, hungry Breakfast, and I will
      give you direction for the making and using of your fly: and in the mean
      time, there is your Rod and line; and my advice is, that you fish as you
      see mee do, and lets try which can catch the first fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. I thank you, Master, I will observe and practice your
      direction as far as I am able.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Look you Scholer, you see I have hold of a good fish: I now
      see it is a <i>Trout</i>; I pray put that net under him, and touch not my
      line, for if you do, then wee break all. Well done, Scholer, I thank you.
      Now for an other. Trust me, I have another bite: Come Scholer, come lay
      down your Rod, and help me to land this as you did the other. So, now we
      shall be sure to have a good dish of fish for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. I am glad of that, but I have no fortune; sure Master yours
      is a better Rod, and better Tackling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Nay then, take mine and I will fish with yours. Look you,
      Scholer, I have another: come, do as you did before. And now I have a bite
      at another. Oh me he has broke all, there's half a line and a good hook
      lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Master, I can neither catch with the first nor second Angle;
      I have no fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Look you, Scholer, I have yet another: and now having caught
      three brace of <i>Trouts</i>, I will tel you a short Tale as we walk
      towards our Breakfast. A Scholer (a Preacher I should say) that was to
      preach to procure the approbation of a Parish, that he might be their
      Lecturer, had got from a fellow Pupil of his the Copy of a Sermon that was
      first preached with a great commendation by him that composed and precht
      it; and though the borrower of it preach't it word for word, as it was at
      first, yet it was utterly dislik'd as it was preach'd by the second; which
      the Sermon Borrower complained of to the Lender of it, and was thus
      answered; I lent you indeed my <i>Fiddle</i>, but not my <i>Fiddlestick</i>;
      and you are to know, that every one cannot make musick with my words which
      are fitted for my own mouth. And so my Scholer, you are to know, that as
      the ill pronunciation or ill accenting of a word in a Sermon spoiles it,
      so the ill carriage of your Line, or not fishing even to a foot in a right
      place, makes you lose your labour: and you are to know, that though you
      have my Fiddle, that is, my very Rod and Tacklings with which you see I
      catch fish, yet you have not my Fiddle stick, that is, skill to know how
      to carry your hand and line; and this must be taught you (for you are to
      remember I told you Angling is an Art) either by practice, or a long
      observation, or both.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now lets say Grace, and fall to Breakfast; what say you Scholer, to
      the providence of an old Angler? Does not this meat taste well? And was
      not this place well chosen to eat it? for this <i>Sycamore</i> tree will
      shade us from the Suns heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. All excellent good, Master, and my stomack excellent too; I
      have been at many costly Dinners that have not afforded me half this
      content: and now good Master, to your promised direction for making and
      ordering my Artificiall flye.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. My honest Scholer, I will do it, for it is a debt due unto
      you, by my promise: and because you shall not think your self more engaged
      to me then indeed you really are, therefore I will tell you freely, I find
      Mr. <i>Thomas Barker</i> (a Gentleman that has spent much time and money
      in Angling) deal so judicially and freely in a little book of his of
      Angling, and especially of making and Angling with a <i>flye</i> for a <i>Trout</i>,
      that I will give you his very directions without much variation, which
      shal follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let your rod be light, and very gentle, I think the best are of two
      pieces; the line should not exceed, (especially for three or four links
      towards the hook) I say, not exceed three or four haires; but if you can
      attain to Angle with one haire; you will have more rises, and catch more
      fish. Now you must bee sure not to cumber yourselfe with too long a Line,
      as most do: and before you begin to angle, cast to have the wind on your
      back, and the Sun (if it shines) to be before you, and to fish down the
      streame, and carry the point or tip of the Rod downeward; by which meanes
      the shadow of yourselfe, and Rod too will be the least offensive to the
      Fish, for the sight of any shadow amazes the fish, and spoiles your sport,
      of which you must take a great care.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of <i>March</i> ('till which time a man should not in
      honestie catch a <i>Trout</i>) or in April, if the weather be dark, or a
      little windy, or cloudie, the best fishing is with the <i>Palmer-worm</i>,
      of which I last spoke to you; but of these there be divers kinds, or at
      least of divers colours, these and the <i>May-fly</i> are the ground of
      all <i>fly</i>-Angling, which are to be thus made:
    </p>
    <p>
      First you must arm your hook, with the line in the inside of it; then take
      your Scissers and cut so much of a browne <i>Malards</i> feather as in
      your own reason wil make the wings of it, you having with all regard to
      the bigness or littleness of your hook, then lay the outmost part of your
      feather next to your hook, then the point of your feather next the shank
      of your hook; and having so done, whip it three or four times about the
      hook with the same Silk, with which your hook was armed, and having made
      the Silk fast, take the hackel of a <i>Cock</i> or <i>Capons</i> neck, or
      a <i>Plovers</i> top, which is usually better; take off the one side of
      the feather, and then take the hackel, Silk or Crewel, Gold or Silver
      thred, make these fast at the bent of the hook (that is to say, below your
      arming), then you must take the hackel, the silver or gold thred, and work
      it up to the wings, shifting or stil removing your fingers as you turn the
      Silk about the hook: and still looking at every stop or turne that your
      gold, or what materials soever you make your Fly of, do lye right and
      neatly; and if you find they do so, then when you have made the head, make
      all fast, and then work your hackel up to the head, and make that fast;
      and then with a needle or pin divide the wing into two, and then with the
      arming Silk whip it about crosswayes betwixt the wings, and then with your
      thumb you must turn the point of the feather towards the bent of the hook,
      and then work three or four times about the shank of the hook and then
      view the proportion, and if all be neat, and to your liking, fasten.
    </p>
    <p>
      I confess, no direction can be given to make a man of a dull capacity able
      to make a flye well; and yet I know, this, with a little practice, wil
      help an ingenuous Angler in a good degree; but to see a fly made by
      another, is the best teaching to make it, and then an ingenuous Angler may
      walk by the River and mark what fly falls on the water that day, and catch
      one of them, if he see the <i>Trouts</i> leap at a fly of that kind, and
      having alwaies hooks ready hung with him, and having a bag also, alwaies
      with him with Bears hair, or the hair of a brown or sad coloured Heifer,
      hackels of a Cock or Capon, several coloured Silk and Crewel to make the
      body of the fly, the feathers of a Drakes head, black or brown sheeps
      wool, or Hogs wool, or hair, thred of Gold, and of silver; silk of several
      colours (especially sad coloured to make the head:) and there be also
      other colour'd feathers both of birds and of peckled fowl. I say, having
      those with him in a bag, and trying to make a flie, though he miss at
      first, yet shal he at last hit it better, even to a perfection which none
      can well teach him; and if he hit to make his flie right, and have the
      luck to hit also where there is store of <i>trouts</i>, and a right wind,
      he shall catch such store of them, as will encourage him to grow more and
      more in love with the Art of <i>flie-making</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. But my loving Master, if any wind will not serve, then I wish
      I were in <i>Lapland</i>, to buy a good wind of one of the honest witches,
      that sell so many winds, and so cheap.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Marry Scholer, but I would not be there, nor indeed from
      under this tree; for look how it begins to rain, and by the clouds (if I
      mistake not) we shall presently have a smoaking showre; and therefore fit
      close, this <i>Sycamore tree</i> will shelter us; and I will tell you, as
      they shall come into my mind, more observations of flie-fishing for a <i>Trout</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But first, for the Winde; you are to take notice that of the windes the
      South winde is said to be best. One observes, That
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 <i>When the winde is south,
   It blows your bait into a fishes mouth</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Next to that, the <i>west</i> winde is believed to be the best: and having
      told you that the <i>East</i> winde is the worst, I need not tell you
      which winde is best in the third degree: And yet (as <i>Solomon</i>
      observes, that <i>Hee that considers the winde shall never sow</i>:) so
      hee that busies his head too much about them, (if the weather be not made
      extreme cold by an East winde) shall be a little superstitious: for as it
      is observed by some, That there is no good horse of a bad colour; so I
      have observed, that if it be a clowdy day, and not extreme cold, let the
      winde sit in what corner it will, and do its worst. And yet take this for
      a Rule, that I would willingly fish on the Lee-shore: and you are to take
      notice, that the Fish lies, or swimms neerer the bottom in Winter then in
      Summer, and also neerer the bottom in any cold day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I promised to tell you more of the Flie-fishing for a <i>Trout</i>,
      (which I may have time enough to do, for you see it rains <i>May-utter</i>).
      First for a <i>May-flie</i>, you may make his body with greenish coloured
      crewel, or willow colour; darkning it in most places, with waxed silk, or
      rib'd with a black hare, or some of them rib'd with silver thred; and such
      wings for the colour as you see the flie to have at that season; nay at
      that very day on the water. Or you may make the <i>Oak-flie</i> with an
      Orange-tawny and black ground, and the brown of a Mallards feather for the
      wings; and you are to know, that these two are most excellent <i>flies</i>,
      that is, the <i>May-flie</i> and the <i>Oak-flie</i>: And let me again
      tell you, that you keep as far from the water as you can possibly, whether
      you fish with a flie or worm, and fish down the stream; and when you fish
      with a flie, if it be possible, let no part of your line touch the water,
      but your flie only; and be stil moving your fly upon the water, or casting
      it into the water; you your self, being also alwaies moving down the
      stream. Mr. <i>Barker</i> commends severall sorts of the palmer flies, not
      only those rib'd with silver and gold, but others that have their bodies
      all made of black, or some with red, and a red hackel; you may also make
      the <i>hawthorn-flie</i> which is all black and not big, but very smal,
      the smaller the better; or the <i>oak-fly</i>, the body of which is Orange
      colour and black crewel, with a brown wing, or a <i>fly</i> made with a
      peacocks feather, is excellent in a bright day: you must be sure you want
      not in your <i>Magazin</i> bag, the Peacocks feather, and grounds of such
      wool, and crewel as will make the Grasshopper: and note, that usually, the
      smallest flies are best; and note also, that, the light flie does usually
      make most sport in a dark day: and the darkest and least flie in a bright
      or cleare day; and lastly note, that you are to repaire upon any occasion
      to your <i>Magazin</i> bag, and upon any occasion vary and make them
      according to your fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now I shall tell you, that the fishing with a naturall flie is
      excellent, and affords much pleasure; they may be found thus, the <i>May-fly</i>
      usually in and about that month neer to the River side, especially against
      rain; the <i>Oak-fly</i> on the Butt or body of an <i>Oak</i> or <i>Ash</i>,
      from the beginning of <i>May</i> to the end of <i>August</i> it is a
      brownish fly, and easie to be so found, and stands usually with his head
      downward, that is to say, towards the root of the tree, the small black
      fly, or <i>hawthorn</i> fly is to be had on any Hawthorn bush, after the
      leaves be come forth; with these and a short Line (as I shewed to Angle
      for a <i>Chub</i>) you may dap or dop, and also with a <i>Grashopper</i>,
      behind a tree, or in any deep hole, still making it to move on the top of
      the water, as if it were alive, and still keeping your self out of sight,
      you shall certainly have sport if there be <i>Trouts</i>; yea in a hot
      day, but especially in the evening of a hot day.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, Scholer, my direction for <i>fly-fishing</i> is ended with this
      showre, for it has done raining, and now look about you, and see how
      pleasantly that Meadow looks, nay and the earth smels as sweetly too. Come
      let me tell you what holy Mr. <i>Herbert</i> saies of such dayes and
      Flowers as these, and then we will thank God that we enjoy them, and walk
      to the River and sit down quietly and try to catch the other brace of <i>Trouts</i>.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,

</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. I thank you, good Master, for your good direction for
      fly-fishing, and for the sweet enjoyment of the pleasant day, which is so
      far spent without offence to God or man. And I thank you for the sweet
      close of your discourse with Mr. <i>Herberts</i> Verses, which I have
      heard, loved Angling; and I do the rather believe it, because he had a
      spirit sutable to Anglers, and to those Primitive Christians that you
      love, and have so much commended.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Well, my loving Scholer, and I am pleased to know that you
      are so well pleased with my direction and discourse; and I hope you will
      be pleased too, if you find a <i>Trout</i> at one of our Angles, which we
      left in the water to fish for it self; you shall chuse which shall be
      yours, and it is an even lay, one catches; And let me tell you, this kind
      of fishing, and laying Night-hooks, are like putting money to use, for
      they both work for the Owners, when they do nothing but sleep, or eat, or
      rejoice, as you know we have done this last hour, and fate as quietly and
      as free from cares under this <i>Sycamore</i>, as <i>Virgils Tityrus</i>
      and his <i>Melibaeus</i> did under their broad <i>Beech</i> tree: No life,
      my honest Scholer, no life so happy and so pleasant as the Anglers, unless
      it be the Beggers life in Summer; for then only they take no care, but are
      as happy as we Anglers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Indeed Master, and so they be, as is witnessed by the beggers
      Song, made long since by <i>Frank Davison</i>, a good Poet, who was not a
      Begger, though he were a good Poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Can you sing it, Scholer?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Sit down a little, good Master, and I wil try.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Bright shines the Sun, play beggers, play,
     here's scraps enough to serve to day:
   What noise of viols is so sweet
   As when our merry clappers ring?
   What mirth doth want when beggers meet?
   A beggers life is for a King:
     Eat, drink and play, sleep when we list,
     Go where we will so stocks be mist.
     Bright shines the Sun, play beggers, &amp;c.

   The world is ours and ours alone,
   For we alone have world at will;
   We purchase not, all is our own,

</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. I thank you good Scholer, this Song was well humor'd by the
      maker, and well remembred and sung by you; and I pray forget not the Ketch
      which you promised to make against night, for our Country man honest <i>Coridon</i>
      will expect your Ketch and my Song, which I must be forc'd to patch up,
      for it is so long since I learnt it, that I have forgot a part of it. But
      come, lets stretch our legs a little in a gentle walk to the River, and
      try what interest our Angles wil pay us for lending them so long to be
      used by the <i>Trouts</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Oh me, look you Master, a fish, a fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. I marry Sir. that was a good fish indeed; if I had had the
      luck to have taken up that Rod, 'tis twenty to one he should not have
      broke my line by running to the Rods end, as you suffered him; I would
      have held him, unless he had been fellow to the great <i>Trout</i> that is
      neer an ell long, which had his picture drawne, and now to be seen at mine
      Hoste <i>Rickabies</i> at the <i>George</i> in <i>Ware</i>; and it may be,
      by giving that <i>Trout</i> the Rod, that is, by casting it to him into
      the water, I might have caught him at the long run, for so I use alwaies
      to do when I meet with an over-grown fish, and you will learn to do so
      hereafter; for I tell you, Scholer, fishing is an Art, or at least, it is
      an Art to catch fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. But, Master, will this <i>Trout</i> die, for it is like he
      has the hook in his belly?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. I wil tel you, Scholer, that unless the hook be fast in his
      very Gorge, he wil live, and a little time with the help of the water, wil
      rust the hook, &amp; it wil in time wear away as the gravel does in the
      horse hoof, which only leaves a false quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Scholer, lets go to my Rod. Look you Scholer, I have a fish too,
      but it proves a logger-headed <i>Chub</i>; and this is not much a miss,
      for this wil pleasure some poor body, as we go to our lodging to meet our
      brother <i>Peter</i> and honest <i>Coridon</i>&mdash;Come, now bait your
      hook again, and lay it into the water, for it rains again, and we wil ev'n
      retire to the <i>Sycamore</i> tree, and there I wil give you more
      directions concerning fishing; for I would fain make you an Artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Yes, good Master, I pray let it be so.

      CHAP. V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Wel, Scholer, now we are sate downe and are at ease, I shall
      tel you a little more of <i>Trout</i> fishing before I speak of the <i>Salmon</i>
      (which I purpose shall be next) and then of the <i>Pike</i> or <i>Luce</i>.
      You are to know, there is night as well as day-fishing for a <i>Trout</i>,
      and that then the best are out of their holds; and the manner of taking
      them is on the top of the water with a great <i>Lob</i> or <i>Garden worm</i>,
      or rather two; which you are to fish for in a place where the water runs
      somewhat quietly (for in a stream it wil not be so well discerned.) I say,
      in a quiet or dead place neer to some swift, there draw your bait over the
      top of the water to and fro, and if there be a good <i>Trout</i> in the
      hole, he wil take it, especially if the night be dark; for then he lies
      boldly neer the top of the water, watching the motion of any <i>Frog</i>
      or <i>Water-mouse</i>, or <i>Rat</i> betwixt him and the skie, which he
      hunts for if he sees the water but wrinkle or move in one of these dead
      holes, where the great <i>Trouts</i> usually lye neer to their hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you must fish for him with a strong line, and not a little hook, and
      let him have time to gorge your hook, for he does not usually forsake it,
      as he oft will in the day-fishing: and if the night be not dark, then fish
      so with an <i>Artificial fly</i> of a light colour; nay he will sometimes
      rise at a dead Mouse or a piece of cloth, or any thing that seemes to swim
      cross the water, or to be in motion: this is a choice way, but I have not
      oft used it because it is void of the pleasures that such dayes as these
      that we now injoy, afford an <i>Angler</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you are to know, that in <i>Hamp-shire</i>, (which I think exceeds all
      <i>England</i> for pleasant Brooks, and store of <i>Trouts</i>) they use
      to catch <i>Trouts</i> in the night by the light of a Torch or straw,
      which when they have discovered, they strike with a <i>Trout</i> spear;
      this kind of way they catch many, but I would not believe it till I was an
      eye-witness of it, nor like it now I have seen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. But Master, do not <i>Trouts</i> see us in the night?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Yes, and hear, and smel too, both then and in the day time,
      for <i>Gesner</i> observes, the <i>Otter</i> smels a fish forty furlong
      off him in the water; and that it may be true, is affirmed by Sir <i>Francis
      Bacon</i> (in the eighth Century of his Natural History) who there proves,
      that waters may be the <i>Medium</i> of sounds, by demonstrating it thus,
      <i>That if you knock two stones together very deep under the water, those
      that stand on a bank neer to that place may hear the noise without any
      diminution of it by the water</i>. He also offers the like experiment
      concerning the letting an <i>Anchor</i> fall by a very long Cable or rope
      on a Rock, or the sand within the Sea: and this being so wel observed and
      demonstrated, as it is by that learned man, has made me to believe that <i>Eeles</i>
      unbed themselves, and stir at the noise of the Thunder, and not only as
      some think, by the motion or the stirring of the earth, which is
      occasioned by that Thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this reason of Sir <i>Francis Bacons</i> [Exper. 792] has made me
      crave pardon of one that I laught at, for affirming that he knew <i>Carps</i>
      come to a certain place in a Pond to be fed at the ringing of a Bel; and
      it shall be a rule for me to make as little noise as I can when I am a
      fishing, until Sir <i>Francis Bacon</i> be confuted, which I shal give any
      man leave to do, and so leave off this Philosophical discourse for a
      discourse of fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of which my next shall be to tell you, it is certain, that certain fields
      neer <i>Lemster</i>, a Town in <i>Herefordshire</i>, are observed, that
      they make the Sheep that graze upon them more fat then the next, and also
      to bear finer Wool; that is to say, that that year in which they feed in
      such a particular pasture, they shall yeeld finer wool then the yeer
      before they came to feed in it, and courser again if they shall return to
      their former pasture, and again return to a finer wool being fed in the
      fine wool ground. Which I tell you, that you may the better believe that I
      am certain, If I catch a <i>Trout</i> in one Meadow, he shall be white and
      <i>faint</i> and very like to be <i>lowsie</i>; and as certainly if I
      catch a <i>Trout</i> in the next Meadow, he shal be strong, and <i>red</i>,
      and <i>lusty</i>, and much better meat: Trust me (Scholer) I have caught
      many a <i>Trout</i> in a particular Meadow, that the very shape and
      inamelled colour of him, has joyed me to look upon him, and I have with <i>Solomon</i>
      concluded, <i>Every thing is beautifull in his season</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now time to tell you next, (according to promise) some observations
      of the <i>Salmon</i>; But first, I wil tel you there is a fish, called by
      some an <i>Umber</i>, and by some a <i>Greyling</i>, a choice fish,
      esteemed by many to be equally good with the <i>Trout</i>: it is a fish
      that is usually about eighteen inches long, he lives in such streams as
      the <i>Trout</i> does; and is indeed taken with the same bait as a <i>Trout</i>
      is, for he will bite both at the <i>Minnow</i>, the <i>Worm</i>, and the
      <i>Fly</i>, both <i>Natural</i> and <i>Artificial</i>: of this fish there
      be many in <i>Trent</i>, and in the River that runs by <i>Salisbury</i>,
      and in some other lesser Brooks; but he is not so general a fish as the <i>Trout</i>,
      nor to me either so good to eat, or so pleasant to fish for as the <i>Trout</i>
      is; of which two fishes I will now take my leave, and come to my promised
      Observations of the <i>Salmon</i>, and a little advice for the catching
      him.

      The <i>Salmon</i> is ever bred in the fresh Rivers (and in most Rivers
      about the month of <i>August</i>) and never grows big but in the Sea; and
      there to an incredible bigness in a very short time; to which place they
      covet to swim, by the instinct of nature, about a set time: but if they be
      stopp'd by <i>Mills, Floud-gates</i> or <i>Weirs</i>, or be by accident
      lost in the fresh water, when the others go (which is usually by flocks or
      sholes) then they thrive not.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the old <i>Salmon</i>, both the <i>Melter</i> and <i>Spawner</i>,
      strive also to get into the <i>Sea</i> before Winter; but being stopt that
      course, or lost; grow sick in fresh waters, and by degrees unseasonable,
      and kipper, that is, to have a bony gristle, to grow (not unlike a <i>Hauks</i>
      beak) on one of his chaps, which hinders him from feeding, and then he
      pines and dies.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if he gets to <i>Sea</i>, then that gristle wears away, or is cast off
      (as the <i>Eagle</i> is said to cast his bill) and he recovers his
      strength, and comes next Summer to the same River, (if it be possible) to
      enjoy the former pleasures that there possest him; for (as one has wittily
      observed) he has (like some persons of Honour and Riches, which have both
      their winter and Summer houses) the fresh Rivers for Summer, and the salt
      water for winter to spend his life in; which is not (as Sir <i>Francis
      Bacon</i> hath observed) [in his History of Life and Death] above ten
      years: And it is to be observed, that though they grow big in the <i>Sea</i>,
      yet they grow not fat but in fresh Rivers; and it is observed, that the
      farther they get from the <i>Sea</i>, the better they be.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is observed, that, to the end they may get far from the <i>Sea</i>,
      either to Spawne or to possess the pleasure that they then and there find,
      they will force themselves over the tops of <i>Weirs</i>, or <i>Hedges</i>,
      or <i>stops</i> in the water, by taking their tails into their mouthes,
      and leaping over those places, even to a height beyond common belief: and
      sometimes by forcing themselves against the streame through Sluces and
      Floud-gates, beyond common credit. And 'tis observed by <i>Gesner</i>,
      that there is none bigger then in <i>England</i>, nor none better then in
      Thames.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for the <i>Salmons</i> sudden growth, it has been observed by tying a
      Ribon in the tail of some number of the young <i>Salmons</i>, which have
      been taken in <i>Weires</i>, as they swimm'd towards the salt water, and
      then by taking a part of them again with the same mark, at the same place,
      at their returne from the Sea, which is usually about six months after;
      and the like experiment hath been tried upon young <i>Swallows</i>, who
      have after six months absence, been observed to return to the same
      chimney, there to make their nests, and their habitations for the Summer
      following; which hath inclined many to think, that every <i>Salmon</i>
      usually returns to the same River in which it was bred, as young <i>Pigeons</i>
      taken out of the same Dove-cote, have also been observed to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you are yet to observe further, that the He <i>Salmon</i> is usually
      bigger then the Spawner, and that he is more kipper, &amp; less able to
      endure a winter in the fresh water, then the She is; yet she is at that
      time of looking less kipper and better, as watry and as bad meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet you are to observe, that as there is no general rule without an
      exception, so there is some few Rivers in this Nation that have <i>Trouts</i>
      and <i>Salmon</i> in season in winter. But for the observations of that
      and many other things, I must in manners omit, because they wil prove too
      large for our narrow compass of time, and therefore I shall next fall upon
      my direction how to fish for the <i>Salmon</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for that, first, you shall observe, that usually he staies not long in
      a place (as <i>Trouts</i> wil) but (as I said) covets still to go neerer
      the Spring head; and that he does not (as the <i>Trout</i> and many other
      fish) lie neer the water side or bank, or roots of trees, but swims
      usually in the middle, and neer the ground; and that there you are to fish
      for him; and that he is to be caught as the <i>Trout</i> is, with a <i>Worm</i>,
      a <i>Minnow</i>, (which some call a <i>Penke</i>) or with a <i>Fly</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you are to observe, that he is very, very seldom observed to bite at a
      <i>Minnow</i> (yet sometime he will) and not oft at a <i>fly</i>, but more
      usually at a <i>Worm</i>, and then most usually at a <i>Lob</i> or <i>Garden
      worm</i>, which should be wel scowred, that is to say, seven or eight
      dayes in Moss before you fish with them; and if you double your time of
      eight into sixteen, or more, into twenty or more days, it is still the
      better, for the worms will stil be clearer, tougher, and more lively, and
      continue so longer upon your hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now I shall tell you, that which may be called a secret: I have been a
      fishing with old <i>Oliver Henly</i> (now with God) a noted Fisher, both
      for <i>Trout</i> and <i>Salmon</i>, and have observed that he would
      usually take three or four worms out of his bag and put them into a little
      box in his pocket, where he would usually let them continue half an hour
      or more, before he would bait his hook with them; I have ask'd him his
      reason, and he has replied, <i>He did but pick the best out to be in a
      readiness against he baited his hook the next time</i>: But he has been
      observed both by others, and my self, to catch more fish then I or any
      other body, that has ever gone a fishing with him, could do, especially <i>Salmons</i>;
      and I have been told lately by one of his most intimate and secret
      friends, that the box in which he put those worms was anointed with a
      drop, or two, or three of the Oil of <i>Ivy-berries</i>, made by
      expression or infusion, and that by the wormes remaining in that box an
      hour, or a like time, they had incorporated a kind of smel that was
      irresistibly attractive, enough to force any fish, within the smel of
      them, to bite. This I heard not long since from a friend, but have not
      tryed it; yet I grant it probable, and refer my Reader to Sir <i>Francis
      Bacons</i> Natural History, where he proves fishes may hear; and I am
      certain <i>Gesner</i> sayes, the <i>Otter</i> can smell in the water, and
      know not that but fish may do so too: 'tis left for a lover of Angling, or
      any that desires to improve that Art, to try this conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall also impart another experiment (but not tryed by my selfe) which I
      wil deliver in the same words as it was by a friend, given me in writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Take the stinking oil drawn out of</i> Poly pody <i>of the</i> Oak, <i>by
      a retort mixt with</i> Turpentine, <i>and Hive-honey, and annoint your
      bait therewith, and it will doubtlesse draw the fish to it</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in these things I have no great faith, yet grant it probable, and have
      had from some chemical men (namely, from Sir <i>George Hastings</i> and
      others) an affirmation of them to be very advantageous: but no more of
      these, especially not in this place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might here, before I take my leave of the <i>Salmon</i>, tell you, that
      there is more then one sort of them, as namely, a <i>Tecon</i>, and
      another called in some places a <i>Samlet</i>, or by some, a <i>Skegger</i>:
      but these (and others which I forbear to name) may be fish of another
      kind, and differ, as we know a <i>Herring</i> and a <i>Pilcher</i> do; but
      must by me be left to the disquisitions of men of more leisure and of
      greater abilities, then I profess myself to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      And lastly, I am to borrow so much of your promised patience, as to tell
      you, that the <i>Trout</i> or <i>Salmon</i>, being in season, have at
      their first taking out of the water (which continues during life) their
      bodies adorned, the one with such red spots, and the other with black or
      blackish spots, which gives them such an addition of natural beautie, as I
      (that yet am no enemy to it) think was never given to any woman by the
      Artificial Paint or Patches in which they so much pride themselves in this
      age. And so I shall leave them and proceed to some Observations of the <i>Pike</i>.

      CHAP. VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. It is not to be doubted but that the <i>Luce</i>, or <i>Pikrell</i>,
      or <i>Pike</i> breeds by Spawning; and yet <i>Gesner</i> sayes, that some
      of them breed, where none ever was, out of a weed called <i>Pikrell-weed</i>,
      and other glutinous matter, which with the help of the Suns heat proves in
      some particular ponds (apted by nature for it) to become <i>Pikes</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir <i>Francis Bacon</i> [in his History of Life and Death] observes the
      <i>Pike</i> to be the longest lived of any fresh water fish, and yet that
      his life is not usually above fortie years; and yet <i>Gesner</i> mentions
      a <i>Pike</i> taken in <i>Swedeland</i> in the year 1449, with a Ring
      about his neck, declaring he was put into the Pond by <i>Frederick</i> the
      second, more then two hundred years before he was last taken, as the
      Inscription of that Ring, being Greek, was interpreted by the then Bishop
      of <i>Worms</i>. But of this no more, but that it is observed that the old
      or very great <i>Pikes</i> have in them more of state then goodness; the
      smaller or middle siz'd <i>Pikes</i> being by the most and choicest
      palates observed to be the best meat; but contrary, the <i>Eele</i> is
      observed to be the better for age and bigness.
    </p>
    <p>
      All <i>Pikes</i> that live long prove chargeable to their keepers, because
      their life is maintained by the death of so many other fish, even those of
      his owne kind, which has made him by some Writers to bee called the Tyrant
      of the Rivers, or the Fresh water-wolf, by reason of his bold, greedy,
      devouring disposition; which is so keen, as <i>Gesner</i> relates, a man
      going to a Pond (where it seems a <i>Pike</i> had devoured all the fish)
      to water his Mule, had a <i>Pike</i> bit his Mule by the lips, to which
      the <i>Pike</i> hung so fast, that the Mule drew him out of the water, and
      by that accident the owner of the Mule got the <i>Pike</i>; I tell you who
      relates it, and shall with it tel you what a wise man has observed, <i>it
      is a hard thing to perswade the belly, because it hath no ears</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if this relation of <i>Gesners</i> bee dis-believed, it is too evident
      to bee doubted that a <i>Pike</i> will devoure a fish of his own kind,
      that shall be bigger then this belly or throat will receive; and swallow a
      part of him, and let the other part remaine in his mouth till the
      swallowed part be digested, and then swallow that other part that was in
      his mouth, and so put it over by degrees. And it is observed, that the <i>Pike</i>
      will eat venemous things (as some kind of <i>Frogs</i> are) and yet live
      without being harmed by them: for, as some say, he has in him a natural
      Balsome or Antidote against all Poison: and others, that he never eats a
      venemous <i>Frog</i> till he hath first killed her, and then (as <i>Ducks</i>
      are observed to do to <i>Frogs</i> in Spawning time, at which time some <i>Frogs</i>
      are observed to be venemous) so throughly washt her, by tumbling her up
      and down in the water, that he may devour her without danger. And <i>Gesner</i>
      affirms, that a <i>Polonian</i> Gentleman did faithfully assure him, he
      had seen two young Geese at one time in the belly of a <i>Pike</i>: and
      hee observes, that in <i>Spain</i> there is no <i>Pikes</i>, and that the
      biggest are in the <i>Lake Thracimane</i> in <i>Italy</i>, and the next,
      if not equal to them, are the <i>Pikes</i> of <i>England</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Pike</i> is also observed to be a melancholly, and a bold fish:
      Melancholly, because he alwaies swims or rests himselfe alone, and never
      swims in sholes, or with company, as <i>Roach</i>, and <i>Dace</i>, and
      most other fish do: And bold, because he fears not a shadow, or to see or
      be seen of any body, as the <i>Trout</i> and <i>Chub</i>, and all other
      fish do.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is observed by <i>Gesner</i>, that the bones, and hearts, &amp;
      gals of <i>Pikes</i> are very medicinable for several Diseases, as to stop
      bloud, to abate Fevers, to cure Agues, to oppose or expel the infection of
      the Plague, and to be many wayes medicinable and useful for the good of
      mankind; but that the biting of a <i>Pike</i> is venemous and hard to be
      cured.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is observed, that the <i>Pike</i> is a fish that breeds but once a
      year, and that other fish (as namely <i>Loaches</i>) do breed oftner; as
      we are certaine Pigeons do almost every month, and yet the Hawk, a bird of
      prey (as the <i>Pike</i> is of fish) breeds but once in twelve months: and
      you are to note, that his time of breeding or Spawning is usually about
      the end of <i>February</i>; or somewhat later, in <i>March</i>, as the
      weather proves colder or warmer: and to note, that his manner of breeding
      is thus, a He and a She <i>Pike</i> will usually go together out of a
      River into some ditch or creek, and that there the Spawner casts her eggs,
      and the Melter hovers over her all that time that she is casting her
      Spawn, but touches her not. I might say more of this, but it might be
      thought curiosity or worse, and shall therefore forbear it, and take up so
      much of your attention as to tell you that the best of <i>Pikes</i> are
      noted to be in Rivers, then those in great Ponds or Meres, and the worst
      in smal Ponds.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now I shall proceed to give you some directions how to catch this <i>Pike</i>,
      which you have with so much patience heard me talk of.

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%"> <img alt="pike (39K)" src="images/pike.jpg" width="100%" /></div>
    <p>
      His feeding is usually <i>fish</i> or <i>frogs</i>, and sometime a weed of
      his owne, called <i>Pikrel-weed</i>, of which I told you some think some
      <i>Pikes</i> are bred; for they have observed, that where no <i>Pikes</i>
      have been put into a Pond, yet that there they have been found, and that
      there has been plenty of that weed in that Pond, and that that weed both
      breeds and feeds them; but whether those <i>Pikes</i> so bred will ever
      breed by generation as the others do, I shall leave to the disquisitions
      of men of more curiosity and leisure then I profess my self to have; and
      shall proceed to tell you, that you may fish for a <i>Pike</i>, either
      with a ledger, or a walking-bait; and you are to note, that I call that a
      ledger which is fix'd, or made to rest in one certaine place when you
      shall be absent; and that I call that a walking bait, which you take with
      you, and have ever in motion. Concerning which two, I shall give you this
      direction, That your ledger bait is best to be a living bait, whether it
      be a fish or a Frog; and that you may make them live the longer, you may,
      or indeed you must take this course:
    </p>
    <p>
      First, for your live bait of fish, a <i>Roch</i> or <i>Dace</i> is (I
      think) best and most tempting, and a <i>Pearch</i> the longest liv'd on a
      hook; you must take your knife, (which cannot be too sharp) and betwixt
      the head and the fin on his back, cut or make an insition, or such a scar
      as you may put the arming wyer of your hook into it, with as little
      bruising or hurting the fish as Art and diligence will enable you to do,
      and so carrying your arming wyer along his back, unto, or neer the tail of
      your fish, betwixt the skin and the body of it, draw out that wyer or
      arming of your hook at another scar neer to his tail; then tye him about
      it with thred, but no harder then of necessitie you must to prevent
      hurting the fish; and the better to avoid hurting the fish, some have a
      kind of probe to open the way, for the more easie entrance and passage of
      your wyer or arming: but as for these, time and a little experience will
      teach you better then I can by words; for of this I will for the present
      say no more, but come next to give you some directions how to bait your
      hook with a Frog.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. But, good Master, did not you say even now, that some <i>Frogs</i>
      were venemous, and is it not dangerous to touch them?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Yes, but I wil give you some Rules or Cautions concerning
      them: And first, you are to note, there is two kinds of <i>Frogs</i>; that
      is to say, (if I may so express my self) a <i>flesh</i> and <i>a fish-frog</i>:
      by flesh <i>frogs</i>, I mean, <i>frogs</i> that breed and live on the
      land; and of these there be several sorts and colours, some being peckled,
      some greenish, some blackish, or brown: the green <i>Frog</i>, which is a
      smal one, is by <i>Topsell</i> taken to be venemous; and so is the <i>Padock</i>,
      or <i>Frog-Padock</i>, which usually keeps or breeds on the land, and is
      very large and bony, and big, especially the She <i>frog</i> of that kind;
      yet these wil sometime come into the water, but it is not often; and the
      land <i>frogs</i> are some of them observed by him, to breed by laying
      eggs, and others to breed of the slime and dust of the earth, and that in
      winter they turn to slime again, and that the next Summer that very slime
      returns to be a living creature; this is the opinion of <i>Pliny</i>: and
      [in his 16th Book De subtil. ex.] <i>Cardanus</i> undertakes to give
      reason for the raining of <i>Frogs</i>; but if it were in my power, it
      should rain none but water <i>Frogs</i>, for those I think are not
      venemous, especially the right water <i>Frog</i>, which about <i>February</i>
      or <i>March</i> breeds in ditches by slime and blackish eggs in that
      slime, about which time of breeding the He and She <i>frog</i> are
      observed to use divers simber salts, and to croke and make a noise, which
      the land <i>frog</i>, or <i>Padock frog</i> never does. Now of these water
      <i>Frogs</i>, you are to chuse the yellowest that you can get, for that
      the <i>Pike</i> ever likes best. And thus use your <i>Frog</i>, that he
      may continue long alive:
    </p>
    <p>
      Put your hook into his mouth, which you may easily do from about the
      middle of <i>April</i> till <i>August</i>, and then the <i>Frogs</i> mouth
      grows up and he continues so for at least six months without eating, but
      is sustained, none, but he whose name is Wonderful, knows how. I say, put
      your hook, I mean the arming wire, through his mouth and out at his gills,
      and then with a fine needle and Silk sow the upper part of his leg with
      only one stitch to the armed wire of your hook, or tie the <i>frogs</i>
      leg above the upper joint to the armed wire, and in so doing use him as
      though you loved him, that is, harme him as little as you may possibly,
      that he may live the longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, having given you this direction for the baiting your ledger hook
      with a live <i>fish</i> or <i>frog</i>, my next must be to tell you, how
      your hook thus baited must or may be used; and it is thus: Having fastned
      your hook to a line, which if it be not fourteen yards long, should not be
      less then twelve; you are to fasten that line to any bow neer to a hole
      where a <i>Pike</i> is, or is likely to lye, or to have a haunt, and then
      wind your line on any forked stick, all your line, except a half yard of
      it, or rather more, and split that forked stick with such a nick or notch
      at one end of it, as may keep the line from any more of it ravelling from
      about the stick, then so much of it as you intended; and chuse your forked
      stick to be of that bigness as may keep the <i>fish</i> or <i>frog</i>
      from pulling the forked stick under the water till the <i>Pike</i> bites,
      and then the <i>Pike</i> having pulled the line forth of the clift or nick
      in which it was gently fastened, will have line enough to go to his hold
      and powch the bait: and if you would have this ledger bait to keep at a
      fixt place, undisturbed by wind or other accidents which may drive it to
      the shoare side (for you are to note that it is likeliest to catch a <i>Pike</i>
      in the midst of the water) then hang a small Plummet of lead, a stone, or
      piece of tyle, or a turfe in a string, and cast it into the water, with
      the forked stick to hang upon the ground, to be as an Anchor to keep the
      forked stick from moving out of your intended place till the <i>Pike</i>
      come. This I take to be a very good way, to use so many ledger baits as
      you intend to make tryal of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or if you bait your hooks thus, with live fish or Frogs, and in a windy
      day fasten them thus to a bow or bundle of straw, and by the help of that
      wind can get them to move cross a <i>Pond</i> or <i>Mere</i>, you are like
      to stand still on the shoar and see sport, if there be any store of <i>Pikes</i>;
      or these live baits may make sport, being tied about the body or wings of
      a <i>Goose</i> or <i>Duck</i>, and she chased over a Pond: and the like
      may be done with turning three or four live baits thus fastened to
      bladders, or boughs, or bottles of hay, or flags, to swim down a River,
      whilst you walk quietly on the shore along with them, and are still in
      expectation of sport. The rest must be taught you by practice, for time
      will not alow me to say more of this kind of fishing with live baits.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for your dead bait for a <i>Pike</i>, for that you may be taught by
      one dayes going a fishing with me or any other body that fishes for him,
      for the baiting your hook with a dead <i>Gudgion</i> or a <i>Roch</i>, and
      moving it up and down the water, is too easie a thing to take up any time
      to direct you to do it; and yet, because I cut you short in that, I will
      commute for it, by telling you that that was told me for a secret: it is
      this:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dissolve</i> Gum of Ivie <i>in Oyle of</i> Spike, <i>and therewith
      annoint your dead bait for a</i> Pike, <i>and then cast it into a likely
      place, and when it has layen a short time at the bottom, draw it towards
      the top of the water, and so up the stream, and it is more then likely
      that you have a</i> Pike <i>follow you with more then common eagerness</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has not been tryed by me, but told me by a friend of note, that
      pretended to do me a courtesie: but if this direction to catch a <i>Pike</i>
      thus do you no good, I am certaine this direction how to roste him when he
      is caught, is choicely good, for I have tryed it, and it is somewhat the
      better for not being common; but with my direction you must take this
      Caution, that your Pike must not be a smal one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>First open your</i> Pike <i>at the gills, and if need be, cut also a
      little slit towards his belly; out of these, take his guts, and keep his
      liver, which you are to shred very small with</i> Time, Sweet Margerom, <i>and
      a little</i> Winter-Savoury; <i>to these put some pickled</i> Oysters, <i>and
      some</i> Anchovis, <i>both these last whole (for the</i> Anchovis <i>will
      melt, and the</i> Oysters <i>should not) to these you must add also a
      pound of sweet</i> Butter, <i>which you are to mix with the herbs that are
      shred, and let them all be well salted (if the</i> Pike <i>be more then a
      yard long, then you may put into these herbs more then a pound, or if he
      be less, then less</i> Butter <i>will suffice:) these being thus mixt,
      with a blade or two of Mace, must be put into the</i> Pikes <i>belly, and
      then his belly sowed up; then you are to thrust the spit through his mouth
      out at his tail; and then with four, or five, or six split sticks or very
      thin laths, and a convenient quantitie of tape or filiting, these laths
      are to be tyed roundabout the</i> Pikes <i>body, from his head to his
      tail, and the tape tied somewhat thick to prevent his breaking or falling
      off from the spit; let him be rosted very leisurely, and often basted with
      Claret wine, and Anchovis, and butter mixt together, and also with what
      moisture falls from him into the pan: when you have rosted him
      sufficiently, you are to hold under him (when you unwind or cut the tape
      that ties him) such a dish as you purpose to eat him out of, and let him
      fall into it with the sawce that is rosted in his belly; and by this means
      the</i> Pike <i>will be kept unbroken and complete; then to the sawce,
      which was within him, and also in the pan, you are to add a fit quantity
      of the best butter, and to squeeze the juice of three or four Oranges:
      lastly, you may either put into the</i> Pike <i>with the</i> Oysters, <i>two
      cloves of Garlick, and take it whole out when the</i> Pike <i>is cut off
      the spit, or to give the sawce a hogoe, let the dish (into which you let
      the</i> Pike <i>fall) be rubed with it; the using or not using of this
      Garlick is left to your discretion. This dish of meat is too good for any
      but Anglers or honest men; and, I trust, you wil prove both, and therefore
      I have trusted you with this Secret. And now I shall proceed to give you
      some Observations concerning the</i> Carp.

    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. The <i>Carp</i> is a stately, a good, and a subtle fish, a
      fish that hath not (as it is said) been long in <i>England</i>, but said
      to be by one Mr. <i>Mascall</i> (a Gentleman then living at <i>Plumsted</i>
      in <i>Sussex</i>) brought into this Nation: and for the better
      confirmation of this, you are to remember I told you that <i>Gesner</i>
      sayes, there is not a <i>Pike</i> in <i>Spain</i>, and that except the <i>Eele</i>,
      which lives longest out of the water, there is none that will endure more
      hardness, or live longer then a <i>Carp</i> will out of it, and so the
      report of his being brought out of a forrain Nation into this, is the more
      probable.
    </p>
    <p class="toc">

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%"> <img alt="carp (34K)" src="images/carp.jpg" width="100%" /></div>
    <p>
      <i>Carps</i> and <i>Loches</i> are observed to breed several months in one
      year, which most other fish do not, and it is the rather believed, because
      you shall scarce or never take a Male <i>Carp</i> without a <i>Melt</i>,
      or a <i>Female</i> without a <i>Roe</i> or <i>Spawn</i>; and for the most
      part very much, and especially all the Summer season; and it is observed,
      that they breed more naturally in Ponds then in running waters, and that
      those that live in Rivers are taken by men of the best palates to be much
      the better meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is observed, that in some Ponds <i>Carps</i> will not breed,
      especially in cold Ponds; but where they will breed, they breed
      innumerably, if there be no <i>Pikes</i> nor <i>Pearch</i> to devour their
      Spawn, when it is cast upon grass, or flags, or weeds, where it lies ten
      or twelve dayes before it be enlivened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Carp</i>, if he have water room and good feed, will grow to a very
      great bigness and length: I have heard, to above a yard long; though I
      never saw one above thirty three inches, which was a very great and goodly
      fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as the increase of <i>Carps</i> is wonderful for their number; so
      there is not a reason found out, I think, by any, why the should breed in
      some Ponds, and not in others of the same nature, for soil and all other
      circumstances; and as their breeding, so are their decayes also very
      mysterious; I have both read it, and been told by a Gentleman of tryed
      honestie, that he has knowne sixtie or more large <i>Carps</i> put into
      several Ponds neer to a house, where by reason of the stakes in the Ponds,
      and the Owners constant being neer to them, it was impossible they should
      be stole away from him, and that when he has after three or four years
      emptied the Pond, and expected an increase from them by breeding young
      ones (for that they might do so, he had, as the rule is, put in three
      Melters for one Spawner) he has, I say, after three or four years found
      neither a young nor old <i>Carp</i> remaining: And the like I have known
      of one that has almost watched his Pond, and at a like distance of time at
      the fishing of a Pond, found of seventy or eighty large <i>Carps</i>, not
      above five or six: and that he had forborn longer to fish the said Pond,
      but that he saw in a hot day in Summer, a large <i>Carp</i> swim neer to
      the top of the water with a <i>Frog</i> upon his head, and that he upon
      that occasion caused his Pond to be let dry: and I say, of seventie or
      eighty <i>Carps</i>, only found five or six in the said Pond, and those
      very sick and lean, and with every one a Frog sticking so fast on the head
      of the said <i>Carps</i>, that the Frog would not bee got off without
      extreme force or killing, and the Gentleman that did affirm this to me he
      saw it, and did declare his belief to be (and I also believe the same)
      that he thought the other <i>Carps</i> that were so strangely lost, were
      so killed by <i>Frogs</i>, and then devoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I am faln into this discourse by accident, of which I might say more,
      but it has proved longer then I intended, and possibly may not to you be
      considerable; I shall therefore give you three or four more short
      observations of the <i>Carp</i>, and then fall upon some directions how
      you shall fish for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The age of <i>Carps</i> is by S. <i>Francis Bacon</i> (in his History of
      Life and Death) observed to be but ten years; yet others think they live
      longer: but most conclude, that (contrary to the <i>Pike</i> or <i>Luce</i>)
      all <i>Carps</i> are the better for age and bigness; the tongues of <i>Carps</i>
      are noted to be choice and costly meat, especially to them that buy them;
      but <i>Gesner</i> sayes, <i>Carps</i> have no tongues like other fish, but
      a piece of flesh-like-fish in their mouth like to a tongue, and may be so
      called, but it is certain it is choicely good, and that the <i>Carp</i> is
      to be reckoned amongst those leather mouthed fish, which I told you have
      their teeth in their throat, and for that reason he is very seldome lost
      by breaking his hold, if your hook bee once stuck into his chaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told you, that Sir <i>Francis Bacon</i> thinks that the <i>Carp</i>
      lives but ten years; but <i>Janus Dubravius</i> (a <i>Germane</i> as I
      think) has writ a book in Latine of Fish and Fish Ponds, in which he
      sayes, that <i>Carps</i> begin to Spawn at the age of three yeers, and
      continue to do so till thirty; he sayes also, that in the time of their
      breeding, which is in Summer when the Sun hath warmed both the earth and
      water, and so apted them also for generation, that then three or four Male
      <i>Carps</i> will follow a Female, and that then she putting on a seeming
      coyness, they force her through weeds and flags, where she lets fall her
      eggs or Spawn, which sticks fast to the weeds, and then they let fall
      their Melt upon it, and so it becomes in a short time to be a living fish;
      and, as I told you, it is thought the <i>Carp</i> does this several months
      in the yeer, and most believe that most fish breed after this manner,
      except the <i>Eele</i>: and it is thought that all <i>Carps</i> are not
      bred by generation, but that some breed otherwayes, as some <i>Pikes</i>
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Much more might be said out of him, and out of <i>Aristotle</i>, which
      Dubravius often quotes in his Discourse, but it might rather perplex then
      satisfie you, and therefore I shall rather chuse to direct you how to
      catch, then spend more time discoursing either of the nature or the
      breeding of this <i>Carp</i>, or of any more circumstances concerning him,
      but yet I shall remember you of what I told you before, that he is a very
      subtle fish and hard to be caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      And my first directon is, that if you will fish for a <i>Carp</i>, you
      must put on a very large measure of patience, especially to fish for a
      River <i>Carp</i>: I have knowne a very good Fisher angle diligently four
      or six hours in a day, for three or four dayes together for a River <i>Carp</i>,
      and not have a bite: and you are to note, that in some Ponds it is as hard
      to catch a <i>Carp</i> as in a River; that is to say, where they have
      store of feed, &amp; the water is of a clayish colour; but you are to
      remember, that I have told you there is no rule without an exception, and
      therefore being possest with that hope and patience which I wish to all
      Fishers, especially to the <i>Carp-Angler</i>, I shall tell you with what
      bait to fish for him; but that must be either early or late, and let me
      tell you, that in hot weather (for he will seldome bite in cold) you
      cannot bee too early or too late at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Carp</i> bites either at wormes or at Paste; and of worms I think
      the blewish Marsh or Meadow worm is best; but possibly another worm not
      too big may do as well, and so may a Gentle: and as for Pastes, there are
      almost as many sorts as there are Medicines for the Toothach, but
      doubtless sweet Pastes are best; I mean, Pastes mixt with honey, or with
      Sugar; which, that you may the better beguile this crafty fish, should be
      thrown into the Pond or place in which you fish for him some hours before
      you undertake your tryal of skil by the Angle-Rod: and doubtless, if it be
      thrown into the water a day or two before, at several times, and in smal
      pellets, you are the likelier when you fish for the <i>Carp</i>, to obtain
      your desired sport: or in a large Pond, to draw them to any certain place,
      that they may the better and with more hope be fished for: you are to
      throw into it, in some certaine place, either grains, or bloud mixt with
      Cow-dung, or with bran; or any Garbage, as Chickens guts or the like, and
      then some of your smal sweet pellets, with which you purpose to angle;
      these smal pellets, being few of them thrown in as you are Angling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And your Paste must bee thus made: Take the flesh of a Rabet or Cat cut
      smal, and Bean-flower, or (if not easily got then) other flowre, and then
      mix these together, and put to them either Sugar, or Honey, which I think
      better, and then beat these together in a Mortar; or sometimes work them
      in your hands, (your hands being very clean) and then make it into a ball,
      or two, or three, as you like best for your use: but you must work or
      pound it so long in the Mortar, as to make it so tough as to hang upon
      your hook without washing from it, yet not too hard; or that you may the
      better keep it on your hook, you may kneade with your Paste a little (and
      not much) white or yellowish wool.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you would have this Paste keep all the year for any other fish,
      then mix with it <i>Virgins-wax</i> and <i>clarified honey</i>, and work
      them together with your hands before the fire; then make these into balls,
      and it will keep all the yeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you fish for a <i>Carp</i> with Gentles, then put upon your hook a
      small piece of Scarlet about this bigness {breadth of two letters}, it
      being soked in, or anointed with <i>Oyl of Peter</i>, called by some, <i>Oyl
      of the Rock</i>; and if your Gentles be put two or three dayes before into
      a box or horn anointed with Honey, and so put upon your hook, as to
      preserve them to be living, you are as like to kill this craftie fish this
      way as any other; but still as you are fishing, chaw a little white or
      brown bread in your mouth, and cast it into the Pond about the place where
      your flote swims. Other baits there be, but these with diligence, and
      patient watchfulness, will do it as well as any as I have ever practised,
      or heard of: and yet I shall tell you, that the crumbs of white bread and
      honey made into a Paste, is a good bait for a <i>Carp</i>, and you know it
      is more easily made. And having said thus much of the <i>Carp</i>, my next
      discourse shal be of the <i>Bream</i>, which shall not prove so tedious,
      and therefore I desire the continuance of your attention.

    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. The <i>Bream</i> being at a full growth, is a large and
      stately fish, he will breed both in Rivers and Ponds, but loves best to
      live in Ponds, where, if he likes the aire, he will grow not only to be
      very large, but as fat as a Hog: he is by <i>Gesner</i> taken to be more
      pleasant or sweet then wholesome; this fish is long in growing, but breeds
      exceedingly in a water that pleases him, yea, in many Ponds so fast, as to
      over store them, and starve the other fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baits good for to catch the <i>Bream</i> are many; as namely, young
      Wasps, and a Paste made of brown bread and honey, or Gentels, or
      especially a worm, a worm that is not much unlike a Magot, which you will
      find at the roots of <i>Docks</i>, or of <i>Flags</i>, or of <i>Rushes</i>
      that grow in the water, or watry places, and a <i>Grashopper</i> having
      his legs nip'd off, or a flye that is in <i>June</i> and <i>July</i> to be
      found amongst the green Reed, growing by the water side, those are said to
      bee excellent baits. I doubt not but there be many others that both the <i>Bream</i>
      and the <i>Carp</i> also would bite at; but these time and experience will
      teach you how to find out: And so having according to my promise given you
      these short Observations concerning the <i>Bream</i>, I shall also give
      you some Observations concerning the <i>Tench</i>, and those also very
      briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Tench</i> is observed to love to live in Ponds; but if he be in a
      River, then in the still places of the River, he is observed to be a
      Physician to other fishes, and is so called by many that have been
      searchers into the nature of fish; and it is said, that a <i>Pike</i> will
      neither devour nor hurt him, because the <i>Pike</i> being sick or hurt by
      any accident, is cured by touching the <i>Tench</i>, and the <i>Tench</i>
      does the like to other fishes, either by touching them, or by being in
      their company.
    </p>
    <p class="toc">
      <a name="linklinkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%"> <img alt="tench (30K)" src="images/tench.jpg"
       width="100%" /></div>
    <p>
      <i>Randelitius</i> sayes in his discourse of fishes (quoted by <i>Gesner</i>)
      that at his being at <i>Rome</i>, he saw certaine Jewes apply <i>Tenches</i>
      to the feet of a sick man for a cure; and it is observed, that many of
      those people have many Secrets unknown to Christians, secrets which have
      never been written, but have been successsively since the dayes of Solomon
      (who knew the nature of all things from the Shrub to the Cedar) delivered
      by tradition from the father to the son, and so from generation to
      generation without writing, or (unless it were casually) without the least
      communicating them to any other Nation or Tribe (for to do so, they
      account a profanation): yet this fish, that does by a natural inbred
      Balsome, not only cure himselfe if he be wounded, but others also, loves
      not to live in clear streams paved with gravel, but in standing waters,
      where mud and the worst of weeds abound, and therefore it is, I think,
      that this <i>Tench</i> is by so many accounted better for Medicines then
      for meat: but for the first, I am able to say little; and for the later,
      can say positively, that he eats pleasantly; and will therefore give you a
      few, and but a few directions how to catch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He will bite at a Paste made of brown bread and honey, or at a Marsh-worm,
      or a Lob-worm; he will bite also at a smaller worm, with his head nip'd
      off, and a Cod-worm put on the hook before the worm; and I doubt not but
      that he will also in the three hot months (for in the nine colder he stirs
      not much) bite at a Flag-worm, or at a green Gentle, but can positively
      say no more of the <i>Tench</i>, he being a fish that I have not often
      Angled for; but I wish my honest Scholer may, and be ever fortunate when
      hee fishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. I thank you good Master: but I pray Sir, since you see it
      still rains <i>May</i> butter, give me some observations and directions
      concerning the <i>Pearch</i>, for they say he is both a very good and a
      bold biting fish, and I would faine learne to fish for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. You say true, Scholer, the <i>Pearch</i> is a very good, and
      a very bold biting fish, he is one of the fishes of prey, that, like the
      <i>Pike</i> and <i>Trout</i>, carries his teeth in his mouth, not in his
      throat, and dare venture to kill and devour another fish; this fish, and
      the <i>Pike</i> are (sayes <i>Gesner</i>) the best of fresh water fish; he
      Spawns but once a year, and is by Physicians held very nutritive; yet by
      many to be hard of digestion: They abound more in the River <i>Poe</i>,
      and in <i>England</i>, (sayes <i>Randelitius</i>) then other parts, and
      have in their brain a stone, which is in forrain parts sold by
      Apothecaries, being there noted to be very medicinable against the stone
      in the reins: These be a part of the commendations which some
      Philosophycal brain have bestowed upon the fresh-water <i>Pearch</i>, yet
      they commend the <i>Sea Pearch</i>, which is known by having but one fin
      on his back, (of which they say, we <i>English</i> see but a few) to be a
      much better fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Pearch</i> grows slowly, yet will grow, as I have been credibly
      informed, to be almost two foot long; for my Informer told me, such a one
      was not long since taken by Sir <i>Abraham Williams</i>, a Gentleman of
      worth, and a lover of Angling, that yet lives, and I wish he may: this was
      a deep bodied fish; and doubtless durst have devoured a <i>Pike</i> of
      half his own length; for I have told you, he is a bold fish, such a one,
      as but for extreme hunger, the <i>Pike</i> will not devour; for to
      affright the <i>Pike</i>, the <i>Pearch</i> will set up his fins, much
      like as a <i>Turkie-Cock</i> wil sometimes set up his tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, my Scholer, the <i>Pearch</i> is not only valiant to defend himself,
      but he is (as you said) a bold biting fish, yet he will not bite at all
      seasons of the yeer; he is very abstemious in Winter; and hath been
      observed by some, not usually to bite till the <i>Mulberry tree</i> buds,
      that is to say, till extreme Frosts be past for that Spring; for when the
      <i>Mulberry tree</i> blossomes, many Gardners observe their forward fruit
      to be past the danger of Frosts, and some have made the like observation
      of the <i>Pearches</i> biting.
    </p>
    <p>
      But bite the <i>Pearch</i> will, and that very boldly, and as one has
      wittily observed, if there be twentie or fortie in a hole, they may be at
      one standing all catch'd one after another; they being, as he saies, like
      the wicked of the world, not afraid, though their fellowes and companions
      perish in their sight. And the baits for this bold fish are not many; I
      mean, he will bite as well at some, or at any of these three, as at any or
      all others whatsoever; a <i>Worm</i>, a <i>Minnow</i>, or a little <i>Frog</i>
      (of which you may find many in hay time) and of <i>worms</i>, the Dunghill
      worm, called a <i>brandling</i>, I take to be best, being well scowred in
      Moss or Fennel; and if you fish for a <i>Pearch</i> with a <i>Minnow</i>,
      then it is best to be alive, you sticking your hook through his back fin,
      and letting him swim up and down about mid-water, or a little lower, and
      you still keeping him to about that depth, by a Cork, which ought not to
      be a very light one: and the like way you are to fish for the <i>Pearch</i>
      with a small <i>Frog</i>, your hook being fastened through the skin of his
      leg, towards the upper part of it: And lastly, I will give you but this
      advise, that you give the <i>Pearch</i> time enough when he bites, for
      there was scarse ever any <i>Angler</i> that has given him too much. And
      now I think best to rest my selfe, for I have almost spent my spirits with
      talking so long.

    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Yes, Master, I will speak you a Coppie of Verses that were
      made by Doctor <i>Donne</i>, and made to shew the world that hee could
      make soft and smooth Verses, when he thought them fit and worth his
      labour; and I love them the better, because they allude to Rivers, and
      fish, and fishing. They bee these:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   <i>Come live with me, and be my love,
   And we will some new pleasures prove,
   Of golden sands, and Christal brooks,
   With silken lines and silver hooks.

   There will the River wispering run,
   Warm'd by thy eyes more then the Sun;
   And there th'inamel'd fish wil stay,
   Begging themselves they may betray.

   When thou wilt swim in that live bath,
   Each fish, which every channel hath
   Most amorously to thee will swim,
   Gladder to catch thee, then thou him.

   If thou, to be so seen, beest loath
   By Sun or Moon, thou darknest both;
   And, if mine eyes have leave to see,
   I need not their light, having thee.

   Let others freeze with Angling Reeds,
   And cut their legs with shels &amp; weeds,
   Or treacherously poor fish beset,
   With strangling snares, or windowy net.

   Let coarse bold hands, from slimy nest,
   The bedded fish in banks outwrest,
   Let curious Traitors sleave silk flies,
   To 'witch poor wandring fishes eyes.

   For thee, thou needst no such deceit,
   For thou thy self art thine own bait;
   Tha fish that is not catch'd thereby,
   Is wiser far, alas, then I</i>.

    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Well remembred, honest Scholer, I thank you for these choice
      Verses, which I have heard formerly, but had quite forgot, till they were
      recovered by your happie memorie. Well, being I have now rested my self a
      little, I will make you some requital, by telling you some observations of
      the <i>Eele</i>, for it rains still, and (as you say) our Angles are as
      money put to use, that thrive when we play.

    <h2>
      CHAP. X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is agreed by most men, that the <i>Eele</i> is both a good and a most
      daintie fish; but most men differ about his breeding; some say, they breed
      by generation as other fish do; and others, that they breed (as some worms
      do) out of the putrifaction of the earth, and divers other waies; those
      that denie them to breed by generation, as other fish do, ask, if any man
      ever saw an <i>Eel</i> to have Spawn or Melt? And they are answered, That
      they may be as certain of their breeding, as if they had seen Spawn; for
      they say, that they are certain that <i>Eeles</i> have all parts fit for
      generation, like other fish, but so smal as not to be easily discerned, by
      reason of their fatness; but that discerned they may be; and that the Hee
      and the She <i>Eele</i> may be distinguished by their fins.
    </p>
    <p>
      And others say, that <i>Eeles</i> growing old, breed other <i>Eeles</i>
      out of the corruption of their own age, which Sir <i>Francis Bacon</i>
      sayes, exceeds not ten years. And others say, that <i>Eeles</i> are bred
      of a particular dew falling in the Months of <i>May</i> or <i>June</i> on
      the banks of some particular Ponds or Rivers (apted by nature for that
      end) which in a few dayes is by the Suns heat turned into <i>Eeles</i>. I
      have seen in the beginning of <i>July</i>, in a River not far from <i>Canterbury</i>,
      some parts of it covered over with young <i>Eeles</i> about the thickness
      of a straw; and these <i>Eeles</i> did lye on the top of that water, as
      thick as motes are said to be in the Sun; and I have heard the like of
      other Rivers, as namely, in <i>Severn</i>, and in a <i>pond</i> or <i>Mere</i>
      in <i>Stafford-shire</i>, where about a set time in Summer, such small <i>Eeles</i>
      abound so much, that many of the poorer sort of people, that inhabit near
      to it, take such <i>Eeles</i> out of this Mere, with sieves or sheets, and
      make a kind of <i>Eele-cake</i> of them, and eat it like as bread. And <i>Gesner</i>
      quotes venerable <i>Bede</i> to say, that in <i>England</i> there is an
      Iland called <i>Ely</i>, by reason of the innumerable number of <i>Eeles</i>
      that breed in it. But that <i>Eeles</i> may be bred as some worms and some
      kind of <i>Bees</i> and <i>Wasps</i> are, either of dew, or out of the
      corruption of the earth, seems to be made probable by the <i>Barnacles</i>
      and young <i>Goslings</i> bred by the Suns heat and the rotten planks of
      an old Ship, and hatched of trees, both which are related for truths by <i>Dubartas</i>,
      and our learned <i>Cambden</i>, and laborious <i>Gerrard</i> in his <i>Herball</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said by <i>Randelitius</i>, that those <i>Eeles</i> that are bred in
      Rivers, that relate to, or be neer to the Sea, never return to the fresh
      waters (as the <i>Salmon</i> does alwaies desire to do) when they have
      once tasted the salt water; and I do the more easily believe this, because
      I am certain that powdered Bief is a most excellent bait to catch an <i>Eele</i>:
      and S'r. <i>Francis Bacon</i> will allow the <i>Eeles</i> life to be but
      ten years; yet he in his History of Life and Death, mentions a <i>Lamprey</i>,
      belonging to the <i>Roman</i> Emperor, to be made tame, and so kept for
      almost three score yeers; and that such useful and pleasant observations
      were made of this <i>Lamprey</i>, that <i>Crassus</i> the Oratour (who
      kept her) lamented her death.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is granted by all, or most men, that <i>Eeles</i>, for about six months
      (that is to say, the six cold months of the yeer) stir not up and down,
      neither in the Rivers nor the Pools in which they are, but get into the
      soft earth or mud, and there many of them together bed themselves, and
      live without feeding upon any thing (as I have told you some <i>Swallows</i>
      have been observed to do in hollow trees for those six cold months); and
      this the <i>Eele</i> and <i>Swallow</i> do, as not being able to endure
      winter weather; for <i>Gesner</i> quotes <i>Albertus</i> to say, that in
      the yeer 1125 (that years winter being more cold then usual) <i>Eeles</i>
      did by natures instinct get out of the water into a stack of hay in a
      Meadow upon dry ground, and there bedded themselves, but yet at last died
      there. I shall say no more of the <i>Eele</i>, but that, as it is
      observed, he is impatient of cold, so it has been observed, that in warm
      weather an <i>Eele</i> has been known to live five days out of the water.
      And lastly, let me tell you, that some curious searchers into the natures
      of fish, observe that there be several sorts or kinds of <i>Eeles</i>, as
      the <i>Silver-Eele</i>, and green or greenish <i>Eel</i> (with which the
      River of Thames abounds, and are called <i>Gregs</i>); and a blackish <i>Eele</i>,
      whose head is more flat and bigger then ordinary <i>Eeles</i>; and also an
      <i>Eele</i> whose fins are redish, and but seldome taken in this Nation
      (and yet taken sometimes): These several kinds of <i>Eeles</i>, are (say
      some) diversly bred; as namely, out of the corruption of the earth, and by
      dew, and other wayes (as I have said to you:) and yet it is affirmed by
      some, that for a certain, the <i>Silver-Eele</i> breeds by generation, but
      not by Spawning as other fish do, but that her Brood come alive from her
      no bigger nor longer then a pin, and I have had too many testimonies of
      this to doubt the truth of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this <i>Eele</i> of which I have said so much to you, may be caught
      with divers kinds of baits; as namely, with powdered Bief, with a <i>Lob</i>
      or <i>Garden-worm</i>, with a <i>Minnow</i>, or gut of a <i>Hen, Chicken</i>,
      or with almost any thing, for he is a greedy fish: but the <i>Eele</i>
      seldome stirs in the day, but then hides himselfe, and therefore he is
      usually caught by night, with one of these baits of which I have spoken,
      and then caught by laying hooks, which you are to fasten to the bank, or
      twigs of a tree; or by throwing a string cross the stream, with many hooks
      at it, and baited with the foresaid baits, and a clod or plummet, or
      stone, thrown into the River with this line, that so you may in the
      morning find it neer to some fixt place, and then take it up with a
      drag-hook or otherwise: but these things are indeed too common to be
      spoken of; and an hours fishing with any <i>Angler</i> will teach you
      better, both for these, and many other common things in the practical part
      of <i>Angling</i>, then a weeks discourse. I shall therefore conclude this
      direction for taking the <i>Eele</i>, by telling you, that in a warm day
      in Summer, I have taken many a good <i>Eele</i> by <i>snigling</i>, and
      have been much pleased with that sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      And because you that are but a young Angler, know not what <i>snigling</i>
      is, I wil now teach it to you: you remember I told you that <i>Eeles</i>
      do not usually stir in the day time, for then they hide themselvs under
      some covert, or under boards, or planks about Floud-gates, or Weirs, or
      Mils, or in holes in the River banks; and you observing your time in a
      warm day, when the water is lowest, may take a hook tied to a strong line,
      or to a string about a yard long, and then into one of these holes, or
      between any boards about a Mill, or under any great stone or plank, or any
      place where you think an <i>Eele</i> may hide or shelter her selfe, there
      with the help of a short stick put in your bait, but leisurely, and as far
      as you may conveniently; and it is scarce to be doubted, but that if there
      be an Eel within the sight of it, the <i>Eele</i> will bite instantly, and
      as certainly gorge it; and you need not doubt to have him, if you pull him
      not out of the hole too quickly, but pull him out by degrees, for he lying
      folded double in his hole, will, with the help of his taile, break all,
      unless you give him time to be wearied with pulling, and so get him out by
      degrees; not pulling too hard. And thus much for this present time
      concerning the <i>Eele</i>: I wil next tel you a little of the <i>Barbell</i>,
      and hope with a little discourse of him, to have an end of this showr, and
      fal to fishing, for the weather clears up a little.

    <h2>
      CHAP. XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. The <i>Barbell</i>, is so called (sayes <i>Gesner</i>) from
      or by reason of his beard, or wattles at his mouth, his mouth being under
      his nose or chaps, and he is one of the leather mouthed fish that has his
      teeth in his throat, he loves to live in very swift streams, and where it
      is gravelly, and in the gravel will root or dig with his nose like a Hog,
      and there nest himself, taking so fast hold of any weeds or moss that
      grows on stones, or on piles about <i>Weirs</i>, or <i>Floud-gates</i>, or
      <i>Bridges</i>, that the water is not able, be it never so swift, to force
      him from the place which he seems to contend for: this is his constant
      custome in Summer, when both he, and most living creatures joy and sport
      themselves in the Sun; but at the approach of Winter, then he forsakes the
      swift streams and shallow waters, and by degrees retires to those parts of
      the River that are quiet and deeper; in which places, (and I think about
      that time) he Spawns; and as I have formerly told you, with the help of
      the Melter, hides his Spawn or eggs in holes, which they both dig in the
      gravel, and then they mutually labour to cover it with the same sand to
      prevent it from being devoured by other fish.
    </p>

       width="100%" /></div>
    <p>
      There be such store of this fish in the River <i>Danubie</i>, that <i>Randelitius</i>
      sayes, they may in some places of it, and in some months of the yeer, be
      taken by those that dwel neer to the River, with their hands, eight or ten
      load at a time; he sayes, they begin to be good in <i>May</i>, and that
      they cease to be so in <i>August</i>; but it is found to be otherwise in
      this Nation: but thus far we agree with him, that the Spawne of a <i>Barbell</i>
      is, if be not poison, as he sayes, yet that it is dangerous meat, and
      especially in the month of <i>May</i>; and <i>Gesner</i> declares, it had
      an ill effect upon him, to the indangering of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fish is of a fine cast and handsome shape, and may be rather said not
      to be ill, then to bee good meat; the <i>Chub</i> and he have (I think)
      both lost a part of their credit by ill Cookery, they being reputed the
      worst or coarsest of fresh water fish: but the <i>Barbell</i> affords an
      <i>Angler</i> choice sport, being a lustie and a cunning fish; so lustie
      and cunning as to endanger the breaking of the Anglers line, by running
      his head forcibly towards any covert or hole, or bank, and then striking
      at the line, to break it off with his tail (as is observed by <i>Plutark</i>,
      in his book <i>De industria animalium</i>) and also so cunning to nibble
      and suck off your worme close to the hook, and yet avoid the letting the
      hook come into his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Barbell</i> is also curious for his baits, that is to say, that
      they be clean and sweet; that is to say, to have your worms well scowred,
      and not kept in sowre or mustie moss; for at a well scowred Lob-worm, he
      will bite as boldly as at any bait, especially, if the night or two before
      you fish for him, you shall bait the places where you intend to fish for
      him with big worms cut into pieces; and Gentles (not being too much
      scowred, but green) are a choice bait for him, and so is cheese, which is
      not to be too hard, but kept a day or two in a wet linnen cloth to make it
      tough; with this you may also bait the water a day or two before you fish
      for the <i>Barbel</i>, and be much the likelier to catch store; and if the
      cheese were laid in clarified honey a short time before (as namely, an
      hour or two) you were still the likelier to catch fish; some have directed
      to cut the cheese into thin pieces, and toste it, and then tye it on the
      hook with fine Silk: and some advise to fish for the <i>Barbell</i> with
      Sheeps tallow and soft cheese beaten or work'd into a Paste, and that it
      is choicely good in <i>August</i>; and I believe it: but doubtless the
      Lob-worm well scoured, and the Gentle not too much scowred, and cheese
      ordered as I have directed, are baits enough, and I think will serve in
      any Month; though I shall commend any Angler that tryes conclusions, and
      is industrious to improve the Art. And now, my honest Scholer, the long
      showre, and my tedious discourse are both ended together; and I shall give
      you but this Observation, That when you fish for a <i>Barbell</i>, your
      Rod and Line be both long, and of good strength, for you will find him a
      heavy and a doged fish to be dealt withal, yet he seldom or never breaks
      his hold if he be once strucken.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now lets go and see what interest the <i>Trouts</i> will pay us for
      letting our Angle-rods lye so long and so quietly in the water. Come,
      Scholer; which will you take up?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Which you think fit, Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Why, you shall take up that; for I am certain by viewing the
      Line, it has a fish at it. Look you, Scholer, well done. Come now, take up
      the other too; well, now you may tell my brother <i>Peter</i> at night,
      that you have caught a lease of <i>Trouts</i> this day. And now lets move
      toward our lodging, and drink a draught of Red-Cows milk, as we go, and
      give pretty <i>Maudlin</i> and her mother a brace of <i>Trouts</i> for
      their supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Master, I like your motion very well, and I think it is now
      about milking time, and yonder they be at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. God speed you good woman, I thank you both for our Songs last
      night; I and my companion had such fortune a fishing this day, that we
      resolve to give you and <i>Maudlin</i> a brace of <i>Trouts</i> for
      supper, and we will now taste a draught of your Red Cows milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Milkw</i>. Marry, and that you shal with all my heart, and I will be
      still your debtor: when you come next this way, if you will but speak the
      word, I will make you a good <i>Sillabub</i> and then you may sit down in
      a <i>Hay-cock</i> and eat it, and <i>Maudlin</i> shal sit by and sing you
      the good old Song of the <i>Hunting in Chevy Chase</i>, or some other good
      Ballad, for she hath good store of them: <i>Maudlin</i> hath a notable
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. We thank you, and intend once in a Month to call upon you
      again, and give you a little warning, and so good night; good night <i>Maudlin</i>.
      And now, good Master, lets lose no time, but tell me somewhat more of
      fishing; and if you please, first something of fishing for a <i>Gudgion</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. I will, honest Scholer. The <i>Gudgion</i> is an excellent
      fish to eat, and good also to enter a young <i>Angler</i>; he is easie to
      bee taken with a smal red worm at the ground and is one of those leather
      mouthed fish that has his teeth in his throat and will hardly be lost off
      from the hook if he be once strucken: they be usually scattered up and
      down every River in the shallows, in the heat of Summer; but in <i>Autome</i>,
      when the weeds begin to grow sowre or rot, and the weather colder, then
      they gather together, and get into the deeper parts of the water, and are
      to be fish'd for there, with your hook alwaies touching the ground, if you
      fish for him with a flote or with a cork; but many will fish for the <i>Gudgion</i>
      by hand, with a running line upon the ground without a cork as a <i>Trout</i>
      is fished for, and it is an excellent way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also another fish called a <i>Pope</i>, and by some a <i>Russe</i>,
      a fish that is not known to be in some Rivers; it is much like the <i>Pearch</i>
      for his shape, but will not grow to be bigger then a <i>Gudgion</i>; he is
      an excellent fish, no fish that swims is of a pleasanter taste; and he is
      also excellent to enter a young <i>Angler</i>, for he is a greedy biter,
      and they will usually lye abundance of them, together in one reserved
      place where the water is deep, and runs quietly, and an easie Angler, if
      he has found where they lye, may catch fortie or fiftie, or sometimes
      twice so many at a standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a <i>Bleak</i>, a fish that is ever in motion, and therefore
      called by some the River Swallow; for just as you shall observe the <i>Swallow</i>
      to be most evenings in Summer ever in motion, making short and quick turns
      when he flies to catch flies in the aire, by which he lives, so does the
      <i>Bleak</i> at the top of the water; and this fish is best caught with a
      fine smal Artificial Fly, which is to be of a brown colour, and very smal,
      and the hook answerable: There is no better sport then whipping for <i>Bleaks</i>
      in a boat in a Summers evening, with a hazle top about five or six foot
      long, and a line twice the length of the Rod. I have heard Sir <i>Henry
      Wotton</i> say, that there be many that in <i>Italy</i> will catch <i>Swallows</i>
      so, or especially <i>Martins</i> (the Bird-Angler standing on the top of a
      Steeple to do it, and with a line twice so long, as I have spoke of) and
      let me tell you, Scholer, that both <i>Martins</i> and <i>Blekes</i> be
      most excellent meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I might now tell you how to catch <i>Roch</i> and <i>Dace</i>, and some
      other fish of little note, that I have not yet spoke of; but you see we
      are almost at our lodging, and indeed if we were not, I would omit to give
      you any directions concerning them, or how to fish for them, not but that
      they be both good fish (being in season) and especially to some palates,
      and they also make the Angler good sport (and you know the Hunter sayes,
      there is more sport in hunting the Hare, then in eating of her) but I will
      forbear to give you any direction concerning them, because you may go a
      few dayes and take the pleasure of the fresh aire, and bear any common
      Angler company that fishes for them, and by that means learn more then any
      direction I can give you in words, can make you capable of; and I will
      therefore end my discourse, for yonder comes our brother <i>Peter</i> and
      honest <i>Coridon</i>, but I will promise you that as you and I fish, and
      walk to morrow towards <i>London</i>, if I have now forgotten any thing
      that I can then remember, I will not keep it from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well met, Gentlemen, this is luckie that we meet so just together at this
      very door. Come Hostis, where are you? is Supper ready? come, first give
      us drink, and be as quick as you can, for I believe wee are all very
      hungry. Wel, brother <i>Peter</i> and <i>Coridon</i> to you both; come
      drink, and tell me what luck of fish: we two have caught but ten <i>Trouts</i>,
      of which my Scholer caught three; look here's eight, and a brace we gave
      away: we have had a most pleasant day for fishing, and talking, and now
      returned home both weary and hungry, and now meat and rest will be
      pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pet</i>. And <i>Coridon</i> and I have not had an unpleasant day, and
      yet I have caught but five <i>Trouts</i>; for indeed we went to a good
      honest Alehouse, and there we plaid at shovel-board half the day; all the
      time that it rained we were there, and as merry as they that fish'd, and I
      am glad we are now with a dry house over our heads, for heark how it rains
      and blows. Come Hostis, give us more Ale, and our Supper with what haste
      you may, and when we have sup'd, lets have your Song, <i>Piscator</i>, and
      the Ketch that your Scholer promised us, or else <i>Coridon</i> wil be
      doged.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Nay, I will not be worse then my word, you shall not want my
      Song, and I hope I shall be perfect in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. And I hope the like for my Ketch, which I have ready too, and
      therefore lets go merrily to Supper, and then have a gentle touch at
      singing and drinking; but the last with moderation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cor</i>. Come, now for your Song, for we have fed heartily. Come
      Hostis, give us a little more drink, and lay a few more sticks on the
      fire, and now sing when you will.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Well then, here's to you <i>Coridon</i>; and now for my Song.

   <i>Oh the brave Fisher's life,
   It is the best of any,
   'Tis full of pleasure, void of strife,
   And 'tis belov'd of many:
         Other joyes
         are but toyes,
         only this
         lawful is,
         for our skil

   Drink a cup to wash our eyes,
   Leave the sluggard sleeping;
        Then we go
        too and fro,
        with our knacks
        at our backs,
        to such streams
        as the</i> Thames
   <i>if we have the leisure.

   When we please to walk abroad
   For our recreation,
   In the fields is our abode,
   Full of delectation:
        Where in a Brook
        with a hook,
        or a Lake
        fish we take,
        there we sit
        for a bit,
   till we fish intangle.

   We have Gentles in a horn,
   We have Paste and worms too,
   We can watch both night and morn.
   Suffer rain and storms too:
        None do here
        use to swear,
        oathes do fray
        fish away.
        we sit still,
        watch our quill,
   Fishers must not rangle.

      <i>Viat</i>. Well sung, Master; this dayes fortune and pleasure, and this
      nights company and Song, do all make me more and more in love with <i>Angling</i>.
      Gentlemen, my Master left me alone for an hour this day, and I verily
      believe he retir'd himself from talking with me, that he might be so
      perfect in this Song; was it not Master?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Yes indeed, for it is many yeers since I learn'd it, and
      having forgotten a part of it, I was forced to patch it up by the help of
      my own invention, who am not excellent at Poetry, as my part of the Song
      may testifie: But of that I will say no more, least you should think I
      mean by discommending it, to beg your commendations of it. And therefore
      without replications, lets hear your Ketch, Scholer, which I hope will be
      a good one, for you are both Musical, and have a good fancie to boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Marry, and that you shall, and as freely as I would have my
      honest Master tel me some more secrets of fish and fishing as we walk and
      fish towards <i>London</i> to morrow. But Master, first let me tell you,
      that that very hour which you were absent from me, I sate down under a
      Willow tree by the water side, and considered what you had told me of the
      owner of that pleasant Meadow in which you then left me, that he had a
      plentiful estate, and not a heart to think so; that he had at this time
      many Law Suites depending, and that they both damp'd his mirth and took up
      so much of his time and thoughts, that he himselfe had not leisure to take
      the sweet content that I, who pretended no title, took in his fields; for
      I could there sit quietly, and looking on the water, see fishes leaping at
      Flies of several shapes and colours; looking on the Hils, could behold
      them spotted with Woods and Groves; looking down the Meadows, could see
      here a Boy gathering <i>Lillies</i> and <i>Lady-smocks</i>, and there a
      Girle cropping <i>Culverkeys</i> and <i>Cowslips</i>, all to make Garlands
      sutable to this pleasant Month of <i>May</i>; these and many other
      Field-flowers so perfum'd the air, that I thought this Meadow like the
      field in <i>Sicily</i> (of which <i>Diodorus</i> speaks) where the
      perfumes arising from the place, makes all dogs that hunt in it, to fall
      off, and to lose their hottest sent. I say, as I thus sate joying in mine
      own happy condition, and pittying that rich mans that ought this, and many
      other pleasant Groves and Meadows about me, I did thankfully remember what
      my Saviour said, that <i>the meek possess the earth</i>; for indeed they
      are free from those high, those restless thoughts and contentions which
      corrode the sweets of life. For they, and they only, can say as the Poet
      has happily exprest it.

   <i>Hail blest estate of poverty!

</pre>
    <p>
      Gentlemen, these were a part of the thoughts that then possest me, and I
      there made a conversion of a piece of an old Ketch, and added more to it,
      fitting them to be sung by us Anglers: Come, Master, you can sing well,
      you must sing a part of it as it is in this paper.

      CHAP. XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Good Master, as we go now towards <i>London</i>, be still so
      courteous as to give me more instructions, for I have several boxes in my
      memory in which I will keep them all very safe, there shall not one of
      them be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Well Scholer, that I will, and I will hide nothing from you
      that I can remember, and may help you forward towards a perfection in this
      Art; and because we have so much time, and I have said so little of <i>Roch</i>
      and <i>Dace</i>, I will give you some directions concerning some several
      kinds of baits with which they be usually taken; they will bite almost at
      any flies, but especially at Ant-flies; concerning which, take this
      direction, for it is very good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take the blackish <i>Ant-fly</i> out of the Mole-hill, or Ant-hil, in
      which place you shall find them in the Months of <i>June</i>; or if that
      be too early in the yeer, then doubtless you may find them in <i>July,
      August</i> and most of <i>September</i>; gather them alive with both their
      wings, and then put them into a glass, that will hold a quart or a pottle;
      but first, put into the glass, a handful or more of the moist earth out of
      which you gather them, and as much of the roots of the grass of the said
      Hillock; and then put in the flies gently, that they lose their wings, and
      as many as are put into the glass without bruising, will live there a
      month or more, and be alwaies in a readiness for you to fish with; but if
      you would have them keep longer, then get any great earthen pot or barrel
      of three or four gallons (which is better) then wash your barrel with
      water and honey; and having put into it a quantitie of earth and grass
      roots, then put in your flies and cover it, and they will live a quarter
      of a year; these in any stream and clear water are a deadly bait for <i>Roch</i>
      or <i>Dace</i>, or for a <i>Chub</i>, and your rule is to fish not less
      then a handful from the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall next tell you a winter bait for a <i>Roch</i>, a <i>Dace</i>, or
      <i>Chub</i>, and it is choicely good. About <i>All-hollantide</i> (and so
      till Frost comes) when you see men ploughing up heath-ground, or sandy
      ground, or greenswards, then follow the plough, and you shall find a white
      worm, as big as two Magots, and it hath a red head, (you may observe in
      what ground most are, for there the Crows will be very watchful, and
      follow the Plough very close) it is all soft, and full of whitish guts; a
      worm that is in Norfolk, and some other Countries called a <i>Grub</i>,
      and is bred of the spawn or eggs of a Beetle, which she leaves in holes
      that she digs in the ground under Cow or Horse-dung, and there rests all
      Winter, and in <i>March</i> or <i>April</i> comes to be first a red, and
      then a black Beetle: gather a thousand or two of these, and put them with
      a peck or two of their own earth into some tub or firkin, and cover and
      keep them so warm, that the frost or cold air, or winds kill them not, and
      you may keep them all winter and kill fish with them at any time, and if
      you put some of them into a little earth and honey a day before you use
      them, you will find them an excellent baite for <i>Breame</i> or <i>Carp</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after this manner you may also keep <i>Gentles</i> all winter, which
      is a good bait then, and much the better for being lively and tuffe, or
      you may breed and keep Gentle thus: Take a piece of beasts liver and with
      a cross stick, hang it in some corner over a pot or barrel half full of
      dry clay, and as the Gentles grow big, they wil fall into the barrel and
      scowre themselves, and be alwayes ready for use whensoever you incline to
      fish; and these Gentles may be thus made til after <i>Michaelmas</i>: But
      if you desire to keep Gentles to fish with all the yeer, then get a dead
      <i>Cat</i> or a <i>Kite</i>, and let it be fly-blowne, and when the
      Gentles begin to be alive and to stir, then bury it and them in moist
      earth, but as free from frost as you can, and these you may dig up at any
      time when you intend to use them; these wil last till <i>March</i>, and
      about that time turn to be flies.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you be nice to fowl your fingers (which good Anglers seldome are)
      then take this bait: Get a handful of well made Mault, and put it into a
      dish of water, and then wash and rub it betwixt your hands til you make it
      cleane, and as free from husks as you can; then put that water from it,
      and put a small quantitie of fresh water to it, and set it in something
      that is fit for that purpose, over the fire, where it is not to boil
      apace, but leisurely, and very softly, until it become somewhat soft,
      which you may try by feeling it betwixt your finger and thumb; and when it
      is soft, then put your water from it, and then take a sharp knife, and
      turning the sprout end of the corn upward, with the point of your knife
      take the back part of the husk off from it, and yet leaving a kind of husk
      on the corn, or else it is marr'd; and then cut off that sprouted end (I
      mean a little of it) that the white may appear, and so pull off the husk
      on the cloven side (as I directed you) and then cutting off a very little
      of the other end, that so your hook may enter, and if your hook be small
      and good, you will find this to be a very choice bait either for Winter or
      Summer, you sometimes casting a little of it into the place where your
      flote swims.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to take the <i>Roch</i> and <i>Dace</i>, a good bait is the young
      brood of Wasps or Bees, baked or hardened in their husks in an Oven, after
      the bread is taken out of it, or on a fire-shovel; and so also is the
      thick blood of <i>Sheep</i>, being half dryed on a trencher that you may
      cut it into such pieces as may best fit the size of your hook, and a
      little salt keeps it from growing black, and makes it not the worse but
      better; this is taken to be a choice bait, if rightly ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There be several Oiles of a strong smel that I have been told of, and to
      be excellent to tempt fish to bite, of which I could say much, but I
      remember I once carried a small bottle from Sir <i>George Hastings</i> to
      Sir <i>Henry Wotton</i> (they were both chimical men) as a great present;
      but upon enquiry, I found it did not answer the expectation of Sir <i>Henry</i>,
      which with the help of other circumstances, makes me have little belief in
      such things as many men talk of; not but that I think fishes both smell
      and hear (as I have exprest in my former discourse) but there is a
      mysterious knack, which (though it be much easier then the
      Philosophers-Stone, yet) is not atainable by common capacities, or else
      lies locked up in the braine or brest of some chimical men, that, like the
      <i>Rosi-crutions</i>, yet will not reveal it. But I stepped by chance into
      this discourse of Oiles, and fishes smelling; and though there might be
      more said, both of it, and of baits for <i>Roch</i> and <i>Dace</i>, and
      other flote fish, yet I will forbear it at this time, and tell you in the
      next place how you are to prepare your tackling: concerning which I will
      for sport sake give you an old Rhime out of an old Fish-book, which will
      be a part of what you are to provide.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   <i>My rod, and my line, my flote and my lead,
   My hook, &amp; my plummet, my whetstone &amp; knife,
   My Basket, my baits, both living and dead,
   My net, and my meat for that is the chief;
   Then I must have thred &amp; hairs great &amp; smal,
   With mine Angling purse, and so you have all</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      But you must have all these tackling, and twice so many more, with which,
      if you mean to be a fisher, you must store your selfe: and to that purpose
      I will go with you either to <i>Charles Brandons</i> (neer to the <i>Swan</i>
      in <i>Golding-lane</i>); or to Mr. <i>Fletchers</i> in the Court which did
      once belong to Dr. <i>Nowel</i> the Dean of <i>Pauls</i>, that I told you
      was a good man, and a good Fisher; it is hard by the west end of Saint <i>Pauls</i>
      Church; they be both honest men, and will fit an Angler with what tackling
      hee wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Then, good Master, let it be at <i>Charles Brandons</i>, for
      he is neerest to my dwelling, and I pray lets meet there the ninth of <i>May</i>
      next about two of the Clock, and I'l want nothing that a Fisher should be
      furnished with.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Well, and Ile not fail you, God willing, at the time and
      place appointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. I thank you, good Master, and I will not fail you: and good
      Master, tell me what baits more you remember, for it wil not now be long
      ere we shal be at <i>Totenham High-Cross</i>, and when we come thither, I
      wil make you some requital of your pains, by repeating as choice a copy of
      Verses, as any we have heard since we met together; and that is a proud
      word; for wee have heard very good ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Wel, Scholer, and I shal be right glad to hear them; and I
      wil tel you whatsoever comes in my mind, that I think may be worth your
      hearing: you may make another choice bait thus, Take a handful or two of
      the best and biggest <i>Wheat</i> you can get, boil it in a little milk
      like as Frumitie is boiled, boil it so till it be soft, and then fry it
      very leisurely with honey, and a little beaten <i>Saffron</i> dissolved in
      milk, and you wil find this a choice bait, and good I think for any fish,
      especially for <i>Roch, Dace, Chub</i> or <i>Greyling</i>; I know not but
      that it may be as good for a River <i>Carp</i>, and especially if the
      ground be a little baited with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are also to know, that there be divers kinds of <i>Cadis</i>, or <i>Case-worms</i>
      that are to bee found in this Nation in several distinct Counties, &amp;
      in several little Brooks that relate to bigger Rivers, as namely one <i>Cadis</i>
      called a <i>Piper</i>, whose husk or case is a piece of reed about an inch
      long or longer, and as big about as the compass of a two pence; these
      worms being kept three or four days in a woollen bag with sand at the
      bottom of it, and the bag wet once a day will in three or four dayes turne
      to be yellow; and these be a choice bait for the <i>Chub</i> or <i>Chavender</i>,
      or indeed for any great fish, for it is a large bait.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a lesser <i>Cadis-worm</i>, called a <i>Cock-spur</i>, being
      in fashion like the spur of a <i>Cock</i>, sharp at one end, and the case
      or house in which this dwels is made of smal <i>husks</i> and <i>gravel</i>,
      and <i>slime</i>, most curiously made of these, even so as to be wondred
      at, but not made by man (no more then the nest of a bird is): this is a
      choice bait for any flote fish, it is much less then the <i>Piper Cadis</i>,
      and to be so ordered; and these may be so preserved ten, fifteen, or
      twentie dayes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also another <i>Cadis</i> called by some a <i>Straw-worm</i>, and
      by some a <i>Russe-coate</i>, whose house or case is made of little pieces
      of bents and Rushes, and straws, and water weeds, and I know not what
      which are so knit together with condens'd slime, that they stick up about
      her husk or case, not unlike the <i>bristles</i> of a <i>Hedg-hog</i>;
      these three <i>Cadis</i> are commonly taken in the beginning of Summer,
      and are good indeed to take any kind of fish with flote or otherwise, I
      might tell you of many more, which, as these doe early, so those have
      their time of turning to be flies later in Summer; but I might lose my
      selfe, and tire you by such a discourse, I shall therefore but remember
      you, that to know these, and their several kinds, and to what flies every
      particular <i>Cadis</i> turns, and then how to use them, first as they bee
      <i>Cadis</i>, and then as they be flies, is an Art, and an Art that every
      one that professes Angling is not capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let mee tell you, I have been much pleased to walk quietly by a Brook
      with a little stick in my hand, with which I might easily take these, and
      consider the curiosity of their composure; and if you shall ever like to
      do so, then note, that your stick must be cleft, or have a nick at one end
      of it, by which meanes you may with ease take many of them out of the
      water, before you have any occasion to use them. These, my honest Scholer,
      are some observations told to you as they now come suddenly into my
      memory, of which you may make some use: but for the practical part, it is
      that that makes an Angler; it is diligence, and observation, and practice
      that must do it.

      CHAP. XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Well, Scholar, I have held you too long about these <i>Cadis</i>,
      and my spirits are almost spent, and so I doubt is your patience; but
      being we are now within sight of <i>Totenham</i>, where I first met you,
      and where wee are to part, I will give you a little direction how to
      colour the hair of which you make your lines, for that is very needful to
      be known of an <i>Angler</i>; and also how to paint your rod, especially
      your top, for a right grown top is a choice Commoditie, and should be
      preserved from the water soking into it, which makes it in wet weather to
      be heavy, and fish ill favouredly, and also to rot quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a pint of strong Ale, half a pound of soot, and a like quantity of
      the juice of Walnut-tree leaves, and an equal quantitie of Allome, put
      these together into a pot, or pan, or pipkin, and boil them half an hour,
      and having so done, let it cool, and being cold, put your hair into it,
      and there let it lye; it wil turn your hair to be a kind of water, or
      glass colour, or greenish, and the longer you let it lye, the deeper
      coloured it will bee; you might be taught to make many other colours, but
      it is to little purpose; for doubtlesse the water or glass coloured haire
      is the most choice and most useful for an <i>Angler</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you desire to colour haire green, then doe it thus: Take a quart of
      smal Ale, halfe a pound of Allome, then put these into a pan or pipkin,
      and your haire into it with them, then put it upon a fire and let it boile
      softly for half an hour, and then take out your hair, and let it dry, and
      having so done, then take a pottle of water, and put into it two handful
      of Mary-golds, and cover it with a tile or what you think fit, and set it
      again on the fire, where it is to boil softly for half an hour, about
      which time the scum will turn yellow, then put into it half a pound of
      Copporis beaten smal, and with it the hair that you intend to colour, then
      let the hair be boiled softly till half the liquor be wasted, &amp; then
      let it cool three or four hours with your hair in it; and you are to
      observe, that the more Copporis you put into it, the greener it will be,
      but doubtless the pale green is best; but if you desire yellow hair (which
      is only good when the weeds rot) then put in the more <i>Mary-golds</i>,
      and abate most of the Copporis, or leave it out, and take a little
      Verdigreece in stead of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This for colouring your hair. And as for painting your rod, which must be
      in Oyl, you must first make a size with glue and water, boiled together
      until the glue be dissolved, and the size of a lie colour; then strike
      your size upon the wood with a bristle brush or pensil, whilst it is hot:
      that being quite dry, take white lead, and a little red lead, and a little
      cole black, so much as all together will make an ash colour, grind these
      all together with Linseed oyle, let it be thick, and lay it thin upon the
      wood with a brush or pensil, this do for the ground of any colour to lie
      upon wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>For a Green</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take Pink and Verdigreece, and grind them together in Linseed oyl, as
      thick as you can well grind it, then lay it smoothly on with your brush,
      and drive it thin, once doing for the most part will serve, if you lay it
      wel, and be sure your first colour be thoroughly dry, before you lay on a
      second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Scholer, you now see <i>Totenham</i>, and I am weary, and therefore
      glad that we are so near it; but if I were to walk many more days with
      you, I could stil be telling you more and more of the mysterious Art of
      Angling; but I wil hope for another opportunitie, and then I wil acquaint
      you with many more, both necessary and true observations concerning fish
      and fishing: but now no more, lets turn into yonder Arbour, for it is a
      cleane and cool place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. 'Tis a faire motion, and I will requite a part of your
      courtesies with a bottle of <i>Sack</i>, and <i>Milk</i>, and <i>Oranges</i>
      and <i>Sugar</i>, which all put together, make a drink too good for
      anybody, but us Anglers: and so Master, here is a full glass to you of
      that liquor, and when you have pledged me, I wil repeat the Verses which I
      promised you, it is a Copy printed amongst Sir <i>Henry Wottons</i>
      Verses, and doubtless made either by him, or by a lover of Angling: Come
      Master, now drink a glass to me, and then I will pledge you, and fall to
      my repetition; it is a discription of such Country recreations as I have
      enjoyed since I had the happiness to fall into your company.

   <i>Quivering fears, heart tearing cares,
   Anxious sighes, untimely tears,
     Fly, fly to Courts,
     Fly to fond wordlings sports,
   Where strain'd Sardonick smiles are glosing stil
   And grief is forc'd to laugh against her will.
     Where mirths but Mummery,
     And sorrows only real be.

   Fly from our Country pastimes, fly,
   Sad troops of humane misery,
     Come serene looks,
     Clear as the Christal Brooks,
   Or the pure azur'd heaven that smiles to see
   The rich attendance on our poverty;
     Peace and a secure mind
     Which all men seek, we only find.

   Abused Mortals did you know
   Where joy, hearts ease, and comforts grow,
     You'd scorn proud Towers,
     And seek them in these Bowers,
   Where winds sometimes our woods perhaps may shake,
   But blustering care could never tempest make,
     No murmurs ere come nigh us,
     Saving of Fountains that glide by us.

   Here's no fantastick Mask nor Dance,
   But of our kids that frisk, and prance;
     Nor wars are seen
     Unless upon the green
   Two harmless Lambs are butting one the other,
   Which done, both bleating, run each to his mother:
     And wounds are never found,
     Save what the Plough-share gives the ground.

   Here are no false entrapping baits
   To hasten too too hasty fates
      Unles it be
      The fond credulitie
   Of silly fish, which, worldling like, still look
   Upon the bait, but never on the hook;
     Nor envy, 'nless among
     The birds, for price of their sweet Song.

   Go, let the diving</i> Negro <i>seek
   For gems hid in some forlorn creek,
     We all Pearls scorn,
     Save what the dewy morne
   Congeals upon each little spire of grasse,
   Which careless Shepherds beat down as they passe,
     And Gold ne're here appears
     Save what the yellow</i> Ceres <i>bears.

   Blest silent Groves, oh may you be
   For ever mirths blest nursery,
     May pure contents
     For ever pitch their tents
   Upon these downs, these Meads, these rocks, these mountains,
   And peace stil slumber by these purling fountains
     Which we may every year
     find when we come a fishing here</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. Trust me, Scholer, I thank you heartily for these Verses,
      they be choicely good, and doubtless made by a lover of Angling: Come, now
      drink a glass to me, and I wil requite you with a very good Copy of
      Verses; it is a farewel to the vanities of the world, and some say written
      by D'r. D, but let them bee writ by whom they will, he that writ them had
      a brave soul, and must needs be possest with happy thoughts at the time of
      their composure.

   <i>Farwel ye guilded follies, pleasing troubles,
   Farwel ye honour'd rags, ye glorious bubbles;
   Fame's but a hollow eccho, gold pure clay,
   Honour the darling but of one short day.
   Beauty (th'eyes idol) but a damask'd skin,
   State but a golden prison, to live in
   And torture free-born minds; imbroider'd trains
   Meerly but Pageants, for proud swelling vains,
   And blood ally'd to greatness is alone
   Inherited, not purchas'd, nor our own.
     Fame, honor, beauty, state, train, blood &amp; birth,
     Are but the fading blossomes of the earth.

   I would be great, but that the Sun doth still,
   Level his rayes against the rising hill:
   I would be high, but see the proudest Oak
   Most subject to the rending Thunder-Stroke;
   I would be rich, but see men too unkind
   Dig in the bowels of the richest mind;
   I would be wise, but that I often see
   The Fox suspected whilst the Ass goes free;
   I would be fair, but see the fair and proud
   Like the bright Sun, oft setting in a cloud;
   I would be poor, but know the humble grass
   Still trampled on by each unworthy Asse:
   Rich, hated; wise, suspected; scorn'd, if poor;
   Great, fear'd; fair, tempted; high, stil envi'd more
     I have wish'd all, but now I wish for neither,
     Great, high, rich, wise, nor fair, poor I'l be rather.

   Would the world now adopt me for her heir,
   Would beauties Queen entitle me the Fair,
   Fame speak me fortunes Minion, could I vie
   Angels w'th India, w'th a speaking eye
   Command bare heads, bow'd knees, strike Justice dumb
   As wel as blind and lame, or give a tongue
   To stones, by Epitaphs, be call'd great Master,
   In the loose Rhimes of every Poetaster
   Could I be more then any man that lives,
   Great, fair, rich, wise in all Superlatives;
   Yet I more freely would these gifts resign,
   Then ever fortune would have made them mine
     And hold one minute of this holy leasure,
     Beyond the riches of this empty pleasure.

   Welcom pure thoughts, welcome ye silent groves,
   These guests, these Courts, my soul most dearly loves,
   Now the wing'd people of the Skie shall sing
   My chereful Anthems to the gladsome Spring;
   A Pray'r book now shall be my looking glasse,
   In which I will adore sweet vertues face.
   Here dwell no hateful locks, no Pallace cares,
   No broken vows dwell here, nor pale fac'd fears,
   Then here I'l sit and sigh my hot loves folly,
   And learn t'affect an holy melancholy.
     And if contentment be a stranger, then
     I'l nere look for it, but in heaven again</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Viat</i>. Wel Master, these be Verses that be worthy to keep a room in
      every mans memory. I thank you for them, and I thank you for your many
      instructions, which I will not forget; your company and discourse have
      been so pleasant, that I may truly say, I have only lived, since I enjoyed
      you and them, and turned Angler. I am sorry to part with you here, here in
      this place where I first met you, but it must be so: I shall long for the
      ninth of <i>May</i>, for then we are to meet at <i>Charls Brandons</i>.
      This intermitted time wil seem to me (as it does to men in sorrow,) to
      pass slowly, but I wil hasten it as fast as I can by my wishes, and in the
      mean time <i>the blessing of Saint</i> Peters <i>Master be with mine</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Pisc</i>. And the like be upon my honest Scholer. And upon all that
      hate contentions, and love <i>quietnesse</i>, and <i>vertue</i>, and <i>Angling</i>.

     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
